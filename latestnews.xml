            <descricao>During her London trip, Michelle Obama announces a new U.S.-UK partnership to improve girls' access to education around the world. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)First lady Michelle Obama, on a visit to London on Tuesday, announced a new partnership between the United States and United Kingdom to improve girls' access to education around the world. The two countries are launching "a nearly $200 million partnership to continue their collective support for adolescent girls' education," according to a news release from Obama's office. Obama met with Prime Minister David Cameron to officially announce the initiative. Special attention and portions of the funds will be devoted "to countries affected by conflict and crisis," with the Democratic Republic of the Congo set to receive $180 million over five years, benefiting "more than 755,000 girls aged 10 to 18," according to the press release. And the United States and United Kingdom will collaborate to improve girls' access to education by enrolling students in accelerated primary school programs, reducing barriers to school access and mobilizing parental and community support. Both countries will also try to improve the quality of materials used in teaching and learning, and to improve school governance. The United States and United Kingdom will share data on adolescent girls' education from various advocacy and academic organizations, including the University of Cambridge and Georgetown University, and "produce research and provide guidance and technical support" through USAID's Education in Conflict and Crisis Network.  Additionally, the partnership will encourage other advocacy organizations to "collaborate and share community-based solutions" to assist vulnerable girls, with the U.S. Peace Corps and U.K.'s Campaign for Female Education set to share "best practices" developed based on their experience. The press release said that "62 million girls are out of school around the world." And it said that "when a girl receives a quality education, she is more likely to earn a decent living, raise a healthy, educated family and improve the quality of life for herself, her family and her community." The release said that "girls' attendance in secondary school is also correlated with later marriage, later childbearing, lower maternal and infant mortality rates, lower birth rates, lower rates of HIV/AIDs and significantly higher earning power." As part of her "Let Girls Learn" initiative, Obama also met with students in London to discuss how the two countries are working together to expand access to girls education around the world. Earlier Tuesday, Obama met with Prince Harry at Kensington Palace, where they talked about "Let Girls Learn" and their interest in supporting veterans and their families.  </corpo>

            <descricao>TV and radio personality Chris Evans will replace Jeremy Clarkson as lead presenter of a new "Top Gear" line-up.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For the millions of loyal "Top Gear" viewers around the world, the wait is over. The wildly popular BBC auto show finally has a successor to fired host Jeremy Clarkson, who was canned in March after punching a producer while on location. TV and radio personality Chris Evans will replace Clarkson as lead presenter of a new "Top Gear" line-up, the BBC announced Tuesday. In his first tweet as new Top Gear host, Evans told fans, "I would like to say Jeremy, Richard and James are the greatest. And NO I'm not leaving the R2 Breakfast Show." Richard Hammond and James May, who were Clarkson's co-hosts, will not be involved in the newest incarnation of "Top Gear," according to the BBC's David Sillito. Acknowledging Clarkson's legacy, Sillito said that while Evans is a household name, Clarkson had a long-running association with "Top Gear" and his were big shoes to fill. Describing the motoring show as his "favourite programme of all time," Evans said he was "thrilled" to get the job. He credited the global success of "Top Gear" to the "brilliant minds who love cars and understand how to make the massively complicated come across as fun, devil-may-care and effortless." There were rumors that Evans, who signed a three-year deal with BBC Two, was a front-runner to replace Clarkson, but he had insisted he was not interested. Kim Shillinglaw, controller of BBC Two, said she was "delighted" that Evans would be presenting the next series of "Top Gear." "He knows the phenomenal attention to detail it takes to make a single sequence of 'Top Gear,' let alone a whole series. He is already full of brilliant ideas, and I can't wait for him to get started," she said. Clarkson, who was first suspended and then dropped by the BBC in March, will be seen for a final time on "Top Gear" on June 28. Production of the new series of "Top Gear" will begin in the next few weeks, according to the BBC. CNN's Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>A British teen's family said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS released a photo showing their 17-year-old in front of an ISIS black flag.   </descricao>
            <corpo>Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The family of a British boy said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS apparently released a photo showing their 17-year-old relative smiling in front of an ISIS flag. ISIS media posted images of a boy the group called Abu Yousef al Britani. In one picture, the teen known as Talha Asmal back in England raises his index finger. A black flag hangs behind him. In another shot, he's posing inside a black Toyota. The family's heartache played out this weekend against the backdrop of two waves of car bombings in Iraq, notable for the role foreigners were said to have had in them.  Asmal's relatives in West Yorkshire, England, were in shock after British media published the pictures of him. Asmal was a "loving, kind, caring and affable" and had no "ill will against anybody nor did he ever exhibit any violent, extreme or radical views of any kind," his family said in a lengthy statement Sunday. It seems that ISIS targeted the teen and "exploited" his "tender years and naivety," they said, adding that the terror group apparently carried out a "process of deliberate and calculated grooming of him." "As a result of this and completely unbeknown to us, his family, and entirely against our wishes, he ended up traveling it seems to Iraq," the family's statement reads. On Sunday, the United Kingdom's North East Counter Terrorism Unit said that police are aware of media reports that allege a British national has died in Iraq. The identity of the person has not been confirmed, and the office unable to give further comment, it said. "We are aware that large numbers of British nationals are traveling to the Middle East for a variety of reasons, and we understand that some of those traveling have resided in West Yorkshire," it said.  ISIS is known for staging multiple bombings at a single time to rattle its enemy, but this weekend's violence stands out -- the seven car bombers who attacked near the city of Baiji were all from countries outside of Iraq, the terror group claimed. According to ISIS, the attackers were a Brit, a German, a Kuwaiti, a Palestinian, two Dagestanis and one national of Turkmenistan. The bombings happened in two waves. During one, four car bombers raced toward and drove through an Iraqi security forces checkpoint. At least 16 were killed and 29 wounded. In another attack, three car bombers blew themselves up near security forces, causing numerous injuries but no deaths, an Iraqi Security Forces paramilitary commander told CNN. The commander told CNN that in the first attack security forces mistook four speeding SUVs heading toward them as a convoy escorting a high-level official. Violence in Iraq continued Sunday. A parked car exploded near a shopping area in Shaab, a predominantly Shia district northern Baghdad. Two people were killed and seven wounded, police told CNN.  Other families around the world share in the pain Asmal's family is experiencing. British teens have been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left her country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport. Asmal's family said he comes from a "close knit, hardworking, peace loving and law abiding British Muslim family." "It appears Talha fell under the spell of individuals who continued to prey on his innocence and vulnerability," they said. If he was one of the suicide bombers, the boy was "ordered to his death by so called ISIS handlers and leaders too cowardly to do their own dirty work," they said. ISIS does not represent Islam, they stressed. "They do not represent in any way, shape or form Islam and Muslims and we are no longer prepared to allow a barbaric group like ISIS to hijack our faith," their statement said. "ISIS Not and Never in our name." They are grieving, they said, and need a break from talking to reporters. They need "time and understanding to come to terms," they said, "with our unimaginable and painful loss." CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad while Ashley Fantz wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Anas Hamdan and Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report. </corpo>

</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Walking the fine, greasy line between ewww and mmmm comes another hybrid snack that the world has somehow survived without until now: the dausage. The half donut, half sausage hybrid is the calorific brainchild of Wales-based Web developer Liam Bennett. Inspired by the successful cross-pastry donut splicings that gave us cronuts and cruffins, the 37-year-old is now producing a range of pork-based products laced with sweet fillings. These include sausages filled with raspberry jelly and -- the weak of stomach should look away now -- custard. "I was trying to think what else you could mix with a donut," Bennett tells CNN. "I was looking at things that go well with sweet things, duck with plum sauce. I thought I'd give the sausage a go because, well I eat sausages." Bennett says the reaction to his dausages was initially skeptical.  "Everyone thought it was crazy to be honest. But when they tried it they loved it. And so did I, I thought it was a great taste." Bennett is currently making his dausages by hand to sell at food fairs, but he's trying to raise funds via a Kickstarter to build the world's first dausage machine. He's also experimenting with other fillings. "We've also looked at more traditional flavors -- apple sauce with pork, mint with lamb -- but to be honest they're a bit boring, I'd rather go for newer flavors. "I think I would try anything." Wondering what's the etiquette for dishing up a dausage? Bennett says they're flexible. "I think it's multifunctional, we've had them at barbecues, hot dogs and things. You can have them with chips, with breakfast, with anything."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Warning: Click on this website that demystifies those three-letter airport codes and your workday be ruined.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Ever wondered why the designation for Vancouver International Airport is YVR? What the story is behind the ignominious SUX abbreviation for Sioux City, Iowa? Where those unique three-letter airport codes came from, anyway? No? Don't worry. A couple of airport trivia nuts have done all the thinking for you and set up a super-cool website explaining the origins of what are known as IATA (International Air Transport Association) Location Identifier Codes around the world. Launched on March 11 as the brainchild of a pair of friends in Arizona, Airport Codes has us diverting more time from work this week than our Facebook feeds or sneaking out for two-hour lunches. After working our way through most of the entries on the site, we reached out to creators Lynn Fisher, a designer and developer, and Nick Crohn, a software engineer, to get the story behind the stories behind airport codes. CNN: What's the inspiration for the site? Lynn Fisher: A few years ago I heard someone talk about the rationale behind airport codes and ever since I've found it interesting. After a Google search I realized there wasn't really a place that explained them all. So we decided to make a site that did just that. CNN: What's the goal of the site? Fisher: It's definitely just a fun project. We don't have any plans to commercialize it. We're happy with sharing the neat information we find. CNN: What's the response been so far? Nick Crohn: Since launching on March 11th, we've had about 245,000 visitors. Lots of people (and airports) have contributed via GitHub and tweeted codes at us. We are excited so many people have found it interesting and are working hard to keep up with the submissions. CNN: Which airport codes draw the most attention? Fisher: The Canadian airports are very popular because many of them don't seem to make any sense. CNN: Which have the most intriguing back stories? Fisher: One of my favorites is definitely SUX (Sioux City, Iowa). It's not a great code and after petitioning to change it twice, they decided to embrace it. Their slogan is "Fly SUX." Crohn: I'm going to go with ORD [Chicago's O'Hare International Airport]. I like how it's so different from O'Hare and hints at the airport's history. That's probably one of the things that's most enjoyable about the codes. They are keys to the airport's history. CNN: How did the whole three-letter code thing begin anyway? Fisher: Weather stations had unique two-letter identifiers and as airports grew and increased in number, they switched to three-letter codes. A podcast called "Layovers" recently talked more in-depth about this. Here's the link. At the bottom is the podcast and the time that part of the conversation happens. CNN: Are there any codes for which there isn't a reasonable explanation? Crohn: We're still pretty stumped about a lot of Canadian airport codes. We've reached out to a few and even they aren't sure where their codes came from. Some of them seem like a completely random pick. CNN: Can people contribute stories behind airports not listed on your site? Fisher: Yes! We have a long list of airports to add, and we're excited for every suggestion!  </corpo>

            <descricao>Prince Carl Philip of Sweden is marrying Sofia Hellqvist, a former model and reality TV star turned charity organizer, in Stockholm on Saturday.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's the stuff of modern-day fairy tales. A handsome Swedish prince is marrying his Cinderella on Saturday -- only this time, his bride-to-be is a former model and reality-TV star-turned-charity organizer. Prince Carl Philip, 36, who is third in line to the Swedish throne, will wed Sofia Hellqvist in the Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace of Stockholm. Swedish media reports have made much of 30-year-old Hellqvist's decidedly nontraditional past, including her appearance on the Swedish edition of reality TV show "Paradise Hotel" in 2005 and a reportedly risque photo shoot for Swedish men's magazine "Slitz." Hellqvist subsequently pursued business-related studies in New York and, while there, also qualified as a yoga instructor. She has more recently focused her efforts on charitable work. In 2010, she jointly founded the nonprofit organization Project Playground, which helps vulnerable children and young people in South Africa's townships. She remains honorary chairwoman of the charity, which also counts Prince Carl Philip as an honorary board member. To mark their wedding, the prince and Hellqvist have set up their own joint charitable venture, the Prince Couple's Foundation, again intended to help disadvantaged children, according to a palace news release. The guest list for the wedding includes royals from a half-dozen European nations and Princess Takamado of Japan. The wedding celebrations began with a private dinner for guests on Friday. After the ceremony on Saturday, guests will enjoy a banquet and dancing at the palace. The couple's engagement was announced in June last year. "We are looking forward to a summer wedding in the middle of June, when Sweden is extremely beautiful," they were quoted as saying then in a press release from the palace. "This will be a big day for us, and we are absolutely delighted."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Architects design 'world's tallest' wooden skyscraper - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Forget steel and concrete. A Canadian architecture firm has designed what they claim would be the world's tallest wooden building.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Forget steel and concrete. The new material of choice for skyscrapers could be wood if Canadian architect Michael Green has his way. Green's Vancouver-based MGA firm along with French architectural partners DVVD and real estate group REI France recently proposed what they claim would be the tallest wooden building in the world for Reinventer Paris, a design competition which sought new ideas for revitalizing architecture in the city. At 35-storeys tall, the tower at the center of the "Baobab" complex -- which also includes a student hotel, green space, bus station and e-car hub -- aims to help solve the French capital's housing challenges in a sustainable, creative and environmentally-friendly manner. Some within the project have even compared the concept to the Eiffel Tower in the iconic structures stakes. According to Green, the Eiffel Tower had a huge impact in inspiring architects to build with steel when it debuted as the world's tallest structure in 1889. Now he hopes Baobab can do the same. "Eiffel's vision redefined the skylines of the world, eventually (starting) the race for height in places like New York and Chicago in the 1920's and 30's and even... (in) new global cities in Asia and the Middle East today," Green told CNN via email. "We love the idea that a wood tower in Paris, however modest in some respects ... will help champion a new global wave of building with more sustainable, renewable and beautiful materials," he added.  The idea of a "plyscraper" may sound far fetched to those unfamiliar with the concept and there are currently no plans to construct the MGA building in Paris. But tall wooden buildings are an architectural development being given increasingly serious consideration in a number of locations around the world. Work is set to begin on the HoHo building, a 275-foot structure made almost entirely from wood in the Austrian capital of Vienna next year. Meanwhile, a 34-storey wooden apartment block could be built in Stockholm by 2023 if architecture firm C.F Moller has its way. MGA has already built the 97-foot tall Wood Innovation and Design Center in Prince George, Northern British Columbia. Other ambitious wood buildings have also sprung up in the likes of Australia and the United Kingdom too. The advantages of wood include its dexterity as a building material as well as its strong environmental credentials. Cross laminated timber -- a multiple panel wood product that is used to form the likes of walls, roof and floor panels -- in particular is has quickly established itself as a strong, reliable and popular wooden building material. "Wood, unlike steel and concrete, sequesters carbon dioxide, storing it away for the life of the building it is in," Green said. "As a renewable material grown by the power of the sun, wood offers us a new way to think about our future." Promotional literature relating to Baobab states it would store an estimated 3,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That's equivalent to keeping 2,207 cars off the road for a year or operating a home for 982 years, MGA state. The tower would also be constructed using a prefabricated construction method, where components are measured and built in a factory, often with space for doors, windows and wiring already carved into panels, before being rapidly transported and put together on site. This could potentially reduce cost, disruption and build time.  On the downside, however, critics say the drawbacks of large wooden structures include the potential for increased fire hazard and the fact that economies of scale are not quite there yet to make it massively cheaper than the likes of steel and concrete. Reports earlier this year suggested the Vienna fire department was liaising with the architectural firm behind the HoHo building to figure out how to minimize the blaze risk. Green confirms building such ambitious structures with timber would mean "reinventing wood; making it stronger, more fire safe, more durable and selecting material from sustainably managed forests." This last point is particularly relevant if wood is to fulfill its promise as a sustainable material. An efficient supply chain that replenished wood at a similar rate to which it was used would be a basic requirement. Then there are the difficulties of introducing new materials and designs into a model for building that's already relatively efficient and cost-effective. Leading timber specialist at the engineering group ARUP, Andrew Lawrence, told CNN earlier this year that shear walls -- the central core of tall buildings -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel for the foreseeable future. Dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material, he said, wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete. Green pointed out that all MGA wooden buildings so far have been built with "central elevator cores in mass timber." Although he added that the foundations have been made in concrete and steel has been used to make connections between the wood. However, Lawrence also pointed out that building with wood can still have its benefits if carefully planned out. "What you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset," Lawrence says. "You will save on the program because it's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially, if you're making an office building, you can leave a lot of the wood exposed, saving on the cost and time of installing finishes." "If you leave the wood exposed, you can (also) have a really nice environment inside the building," he says. As Green and MGA suggest, there would better no location to put wood's aesthetic and structural fortitude to the test than the picturesque city of Paris. Read: The most ambitious luxury home ever?

            <descricao>CNN meets the air traffic controllers who get 73 million people a year safely through UK's Heathrow Airport
</descricao>
            <corpo>London, England (CNN)As they stare out of the four-story plate glass windows of Heathrow's control tower, Jason Cooper and his team should be gnawing their fingernails and swabbing the sweat from their brows. On any given day, they're in control of one of the most insanely busy stretches of airport runway on the planet, guiding tens of thousands of people on and off the ground. One false move could spell disaster: at best the costly loss of a precious runway slot; at worst a genuine aviation tragedy and massive disruption across European airspace. Which is why it's both surprising and reassuring to find, during a recent CNN visit, that the atmosphere inside the tower at Heathrow, the UK's largest airport, is one of almost Zen-like calm. "There's pressure, but no stress," says Cooper, who manages Red Watch, one of three groups of air traffic controllers (ATCs) that staff Heathrow's tower day and night. "I think most of us enjoy the pressure." Under his command today are an apparently genial mixture of men and women of varying ages, all dressed down. They do their jobs quietly and efficiently, talking into radio headsets, occasionally chatting to one another. Outside though, the activity is relentless.  With five terminals and only two runways -- each handling 19 million more passengers annually than any other airport in the world -- Heathrow is perpetually congested. Airliners, including giant Airbus A380s, line up on taxiways for takeoff, while the sky is filled with an endless parade of jets coming in from or heading out to destinations around the globe. It's the job of the tower controllers to keep snarl-ups to a minimum -- a high wire balancing act that requires intense focus and an impressive array of gadgetry. Standing 87 meters over Heathrow, the tower offers impressive views stretching miles over flat terrain. Even on the cloudy day of CNN's visit it's possible to pick out the tower blocks of London's financial district, nearly 30 kilometers to the east, and Windsor Castle to the west. That incredible view -- what Cooper calls "the greatest office window" in the region -- is an essential part of the job. The controllers need visual confirmation of every takeoff and landing, only resorting to radar, radio and computers when the weather closes in. Inside the tower there are two tiers -- a raised central dais where two north and south runway controllers sit back-to-back, and a lower ring occupied by the ground controllers who govern aircraft from start-up at the stand until they've taxied into position on the runway and vice versa. (Air traffic control company NATS has a cool 360-degree panorama of the tower on its website: http://bit.ly/1Hzo7N7) By law the controllers can only work in 90-minute stretches punctuated by half-hour breaks over a six to nine-hour shift. These relatively short work stints help them focus on the task of moving as many planes as quickly as possible -- up to 42 takeoffs per hour on a good day.  Fingers dance over the touch screens as the controllers move around computerized strips (these used to be paper strips) that represent the planes and talk to pilots via the radio. There's tricky mental juggling to perform as they figure out how to maximize takeoff slots so larger planes aren't followed by smaller aircraft that must wait longer for turbulence to clear. At night there are extra complications guiding aircraft along Heathrow's busy taxiways. This is done using a giant touch screen that ATCs swipe to illuminate different stretches of Tarmac -- possibly one of the world's largest lighting control decks. There are also tracking monitors that show the position and movement of all aircraft on the ground, and screens detailing meteorological elements such as wind direction and speed. Cooper shows off a relatively new piece of kit called the TBS -- or time-based separation -- that's proving crucial to Heathrow's traffic flow. Instead of spacing aircraft on approach by distance, it factors in wind speed and works out how many minutes apart they can land safely. All good when everything runs smoothly, but what happens when it doesn't? Much of the control tower's calm atmosphere seems to be down to the contingency measures in place for when problems arise. It's typically overstaffed in case sudden sickness depletes numbers. And, says Cooper, almost every system is backed up at least two or three times.  In the event of a power cut, the tower has an emergency generator. If that fails there are batteries. And if those go, staff can quickly relocate to a standby tower facility in a secret location nearby. The controllers really earn their money (in the UK more than $150,000 per year including overtime for senior ATCs) when disaster strikes and their cool nerves are tested to the limit. Touch screen telephones in the control tower feature an oversized "crash" button, which instantly puts the ATCs in immediate contact with the emergency services and ground crews they need to coordinate with during major incidents. Cooper recalls a 2013 incident involving a fire on board an empty, parked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing Dreamliner that closed the airport and led to a scramble to clear nearby airspace. "It was a very intense day at the office," he says. "Most days here are hard work, some are harder than others. You don't get a job as a Heathrow controller and expect to put your feet up for a couple of hours." Few people, it seems, are cut out for air traffic controlling. The qualifications required are minimal, but ATCs need an innate range of skills that allow them to perform the mental acrobatics needed to keep everything flowing. (Try these games on the NATS website: http://bit.ly/1GyKaTa) Only one in every 300 applicants makes the cut but they come from all walks of life. Cooper says Heathrow employs ATCs in their 20s barely out of school alongside staff with multiple doctorates to their name. The training is necessarily lengthy, taking up to two years. Even when qualified, ATCs can spend 18 months working under guidance before being allowed to operate solo. The same goes for experienced controllers moving to a new airport. And it never stops.  Cooper takes us to a non-descript office block a few miles away from Heathrow where an almost full-sized control tower simulator has been constructed to help train and prepare ATCs and allow them to road test new aircraft and airport structural changes. It's like a gigantic, awesome $2 million Xbox console with a 360-degree screen. "We use it to put our ATCs in nasty situations," says Cooper, his fingers instinctively tapping the screen to line computer-generated aircraft up on the runway. "But it has to be relevant, you can't just come in here and set everything on fire just for the hell of it." Sim manager Daniel Johnson puts his virtual tower through its paces, showing us weather conditions from thick fog to driving snow. He then takes us on a weird, stomach-flipping, out-of-body experience, sending the tower whizzing through the airport and out over London. We also get to try our hand at clearing a few virtual jets for take off. Even though it's not real, talking to the pretend pilot (actually Johnson in the next room) and moving the aircraft strips on the computer to get a pixilated Virgin Atlantic 787 off the ground proves a nerve-fraying experience. Cooper isn't too impressed with the yawning gaps we allow between take offs, but offers some consolation. "Even for us every day is a school day, you learn something about how to do the job differently. "The place changes every day and you have to stay on top of the changes, but I cannot imagine having a job where you didn't."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)While speculation continues as to whether Audi or Porsche might join the ranks of Formula One, the two German car manufacturers' commitment to endurance racing was in no doubt this weekend. Porsche ended a 17-year wait to claim its 17th victory at the prestigious Le Mans 24 Hours event, which had been won by VW stablemate Audi in 13 of the previous 15 stagings. It was a 1-2 finish for Porsche, which returned to Le Mans last year, with F1 driver Nico Hulkenberg and teammates Earl Bamber and Nick Tandy heading off the vehicle piloted by Mark Webber, Timo Bernhard and Brendon Hartley. The winners completed 395 laps of the circuit -- one more than their Porsche rivals -- as 263,500 spectators watched from Saturday afternoon to Sunday in France. Audi's defending champions Marcel Fassler, Andre Lotterer and Benoit Treluyer were third. Hulkenberg, who fitted the race in between his grand prix commitments with Force India, was the first active F1 driver to win the race since Johnny Herbert and Bertrand Gachot in 1991. "Our goal was to have one car on the podium, but a 1-2 victory is amazing," said the German, who was the first rookie to win it since Laurent Aiello in Porsche's previous 1998 victory. "I am very proud of what we achieved. We had a flawless race with a great pace and we didn't make any mistake. The last lap was a bit weird because it was drizzling and people got nervous in the garage," added the 27-year-old, who has yet to win in 83 F1 starts. "After the finish line, it is amazing to see thousands and thousands of people cheering up. I am very happy that we've done it." Bamber was also taking part in his first Le Mans, having been promoted to Porsche's LMP1 program this year for selected endurance events. "The last 12 months have been incredible. I was in the same go-kart club as Brendon Hartley and he actually taught me how to drive," the New Zealander said of his compatriot. "This victory is beyond my dreams. I hope I can come back many more times because it is a great race, and come back next year with those guys." Webber, who helped Red Bull win four world manufacturers' titles before quitting F1 at the end of 2013, said the Porsche No. 19 car had deserved to triumph over his No. 17. "We weren't quick enough. Simple as that," said the Australian, whose Porsche Le Mans debut last year ended in disappointment after mechanical problems. "The guys in the 19 did a great job. All three of them were exceptional for 24 hours. "We served a penalty as well -- I don't know if that would have been enough ... maybe if we didn't have that. Especially in the night, the No. 19 car was really quick. It left the Audis and the other Porsches as well." Lotterer, meanwhile, had the consolation of setting the fastest lap -- three minutes 17.476 seconds on No. 337 -- for the fourth time of his Le Mans career. "I set the best lap in the race, but I would have preferred to win because nobody will remember," the German said. "The Porsches were doing one more lap and we had to push the whole race to try to catch up with them. We had too many issues to win this race."  Meanwhile, in elite motorcycle racing, Jorge Lorenzo closed to within a point of MotoGP championship leader Valentino Rossi by winning his fourth successive race on Sunday. The Spaniard triumphed over the Italian veteran at the Catalunya Grand Prix near Barcelona after claiming the advantage at the first corner from the surprise qualifying leaders Aleix Espargaro and Maverick Vinales of Suzuki. Reigning world champion Marc Marquez is now 69 points behind Rossi after seven races, having crashed while challenging Yamaha's Lorenzo on the third lap. Seven-time titleholder Rossi was second for Yamaha, while Marquez's Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa was third in his home race.

            <descricao>Jozef Wesolowski, the pope's ex-ambassador to Dominican Republic will be tried on child sex abuse charges at the Vatican next month, Vatican says.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The Pope's former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Jozef Wesolowski -- accused of offenses related to child abuse -- will be tried at the Vatican beginning next month, the Vatican said Monday. Wesolowski, 66, is the highest-ranking former Vatican official to be arrested for allegations related to the sexual abuse of minors and the first to be tried on such charges at the Vatican. Wesolowski is accused of possession of child pornography as well as offenses related to the sexual abuse of minors during his time as papal nuncio to the Dominican Republic. Before arriving in the Dominican Republic in 2008, Wesolowski was nuncio to Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. He began his career as a priest in Krakow, Poland, in 1972 and became a bishop in 2000. In August 2013, the Vatican said it was investigating Wesolowski and removing him from his post, but it did not give a reason. Monsignor Agripino Nunez Collado, a Catholic University rector, said an internal church report linked Wesolowski to child abuse and pedophilia. "We have formally opened an investigation," Dominican Attorney General Francisco Dominguez Brito told reporters at the time. "Here we have to work with two legal aspects, first national laws and also international laws in his status as a diplomat, which implies other mechanisms of investigation and judgment." In January 2014, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi confirmed to the National Catholic Reporter that the Vatican's criminal court was investigating Wesolowski. Pope Francis had announced in July 2013 that he was extending the court's jurisdiction in sex abuse cases to include papal diplomats, making Wesolowski's case the first test of the ruling, the newspaper reported. The Holy See defrocked Wesolowski in June of 2014. Wesolowski is not only charged with offenses during his five years as nuncio of Dominican Republic, but also with child pornography charges committed in Rome between August 2013, when he was recalled, and September 2014, when he was arrested, a Vatican statement said. He also faces charges in the Dominican Republic and in his native Poland, Vatican Radio reported in August. Per the pornography allegations, Italy's Corriere della Sera reported in September that Wesolowski's laptop contained more than 100,000 files with pornographic images and videos, some showing naked teens, between the ages of 13 and 17, forced to have sexual relations with each other or with adults. Some had been downloaded from the Internet and others appeared to have been taken by the victims, the paper reported. Three minors and their mothers are among the prosecution's witnesses, according to Corriere della Sera. When Wesolowski was presented with a detention order in September, the paper reported, he issued a statement: "I can clear my position and explain the mistake." Though the Vatican provided few details on the sex abuse charges, Dominican investigative journalist Nuria Esperanza Piera Gainza reported in 2013 that her sources alleged Wesolowski was a regular in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, where he would drink alcohol and pay children to perform sexual acts in the Monument to Friar Antonio de Montesinos, on the outskirts of the zone. "This will be a delicate and detailed procedure, requiring the most careful observations and insights from all parties involved in the trial," the Vatican said. Wesolowski's trial will involve information technology experts and international legal experts to evaluate evidence gathered in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The first hearing is scheduled for July 11. It's been reported that rather than being held in an Italian prison or Vatican detention cell, Wesolowski is under house arrest at a Vatican apartment for medical reasons. The church's sexual abuse guidelines allow local dioceses to make the initial decisions on the removal of accused priests. Papal nuncios, however, are appointed and supervised by the Vatican. Before he was elected pope, Francis said he supported a "zero tolerance" approach to clergy sexual abuse. In 2012, when Francis was still Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, he said that when he was asked for advice by another bishop, "I told him to take away the priests' licenses, not to allow them to exercise the priesthood any more, and to begin a canonical trial in that diocese's court." Shortly after his election to the papacy, Francis told a senior Vatican official to "act decisively" against sexual abuse and carry out "due proceedings against the guilty." In July 2013, the pope made it a crime to abuse children sexually or physically on Vatican grounds. The acts were already crimes under church law, but are now specifically outlawed within the Vatican city-state, which is home to hundreds of people. CNN's Delia Gallagher and Diulka Perez contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>CNN retraces the journey of children from Egypt to Italy finding evidence that many are smuggled by criminal gangs who then use them for illegal activities.</descricao>
            <corpo>Sicily, Italy (CNN)The 13-year-old boy looks off into the distance. He is slight of build with pale, almost yellowy eyes. When you see him you feel as if he has seen far too much already. He is carrying a burden far too heavy for his age -- but despite his ordeal so far, smuggled across continents from Africa to Europe, and now living in a care home, his future could be far worse depending which route he takes next. A CNN investigation spent months retracing the smuggling route from Egypt to Italy. Speaking to social workers and authorities, children and parents, there is evidence that many of the children were smuggled into Italy by the same criminal networks, who once they are in country, use them for illegal activities. The Egyptian government agency charged with advising lawmakers on child protection matters told CNN that they believe in some cases the parents are guilty of trafficking, paying for their own vulnerable children to be smuggled so far from home in the hope of securing the family's future. We were interviewing this Egyptian boy and his friends in the picturesque piazza of a small Sicilian town. They came over to Italy together on an Egyptian smuggler ship. He was 12 at the time and crammed in with hundreds of others. He says his parents paid 35,000 Egyptian pounds (about $4,500) for the privilege, never guessing what it would really be like -- tossed around for nine days, surrounded by vomit, and scared, uncertain what would meet them on shore. I asked him what he would say to all the boys back at home, hoping to follow in his footsteps. He said he would warn them not to come but he also said he knew they wouldn't listen. "Why would they? I didn't," he says. "Everyone does what their mind tells them. They won't take what we say." I asked if, having suffered so much, he'd make the journey again? "What can I do? Yes. The burden back home is still the same." Italian authorities say he is one of more than 1,000 young Egyptians sheltered in 100 Italian care homes now dotting the Sicilian countryside. The cobbled streets and 17th Century architecture is a very long way from the Nile Delta villages many of the boys have come from. I asked one of his friends if he calls his parents and what he tells them about their lives here, and if he's told them how close to death he came. "I tell them nothing, just pleasantries and ask for their prayers. What difference would it make? They need me to make money." These boys tell us their parents went in to debt to raise the fare for their crossing. They saw it as an investment in what they hope will be a better future for the whole family. The children are expected to find work as soon as they can and start sending money home. Here at the care home, that's not possible so thousands of children are disappearing from the Italian social care networks. Italy's Ministry of Labor told us almost 4,000 Egyptian children disappeared from the care system. All the Italian authorities we spoke to who work with these children told us the pressure on the children would be unbearable even for an adult. They fear the consequences to their parents if the smugglers didn't get their money in full, or if the gamble doesn't pay off having sold what little of value they have. The missing children can't work legally. Social workers tell us that too often the children turn to drugs, even prostitution, to get by. Another boy we meet at the home asks me wistfully about Rome, which Italian authorities say is where so many of the disappeared head to. I told him Rome is dangerous for children on their own, especially on the streets. I told him the stories we'd heard from the Egyptian teenagers we'd met in Rome -- the exploitation and the homesickness. The Egyptian children in Rome tell stories of friends selling themselves on street corners -- but they sound suspiciously like they were speaking about themselves. I told him it's better to do it all the legal way and better for him to get an education. He listened politely until I'd finished then told me: "Better to be dead than useless."

            <descricao>You'll want to book a window seat if you're flying into any of these 10 airports.  </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For jaded air travelers, window seats are overrated. Not having to climb over snoring seat mates to get to the toilet often trumps the desire to gaze at fluffy white clouds and brown squares of farmland as the plane descends. There are, however, exceptions. PrivateFly, a global booking platform for private jet charters, has just released the results of its 2015 global survey of the world's most scenic airport approaches. When you're flying into these 10 beauties, which offer views of everything from mountainous landscapes to glittering skyscrapers, you're going to want to be in that window seat. New Zealand's Queenstown Airport came out the big winner, followed by Las Vegas McCarran Airport and Nice Cote D'Azur Airport in France. The PrivateFly Best Airport Approaches 2015 poll was conducted in March and April of this year and received more than 3,000 individual votes, says the company. A total of 147 global airports received nominations. "Our poll has become an annual checklist for the well-traveled, and offers a fascinating mix of global descents," says Adam Twidell, CEO of PrivateFly and an experienced pilot. "From iconic city views such as Las Vegas and London City; to tiny remote airstrips such as Saba in the Caribbean (the world's shortest commercial runway); and the unique beach landing at Barra in the Outer Hebrides." Here are the top 10 scenic airport approaches, according to PrivateFly's 2015 survey. 1. Queenstown Airport, New Zealand 2. Las Vegas McCarran Airport, United States 3. Nice Cote D'Azur Airport, France 4. Barra Airport, Scotland, UK 5. St. Maarten Airport (Princess Juliana International), Caribbean 6. Saba Airport (Juancho E Yrausquin), Caribbean Netherlands 7. Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Canada 8. Gibraltar Airport, UK 9. London City Airport, UK 10. Cape Town Airport, South Africa Previous winners of the annual poll include Nice Cote D'Azur (2014); St. Maarten in the Caribbean (2013) and Barra in Scotland's Outer Hebrides (2012).

</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Days before it was to be published to great fanfare, a leaked draft of Pope Francis' eagerly awaited letter on the environment was published Monday by an Italian magazine. L'Espresso published the 192-page document in Italian online. A Vatican embargo on the letter, called an encyclical, was set to lift at 6 a.m. ET on Thursday. In a statement, the Vatican said that the leaked document is only a draft and the rules of the embargo remain in place. "We ask journalists to respect professional standards, which call for the official publication of the final text," the Vatican said. Derived from the Greek word for "circle," a papal encyclical is a letter from the pope to Catholic clergy and laypeople around the world. Often, the letters clarify Catholic doctrine, reiterate points of dogma and address contemporary issues through the light of church teachings. Pope Francis, though, has said he hopes his letter will reach a wider audience, including world leaders meeting for several key environmental summits this year. The upcoming encyclical will be the first to focus exclusively on creation care, the Christian idea that God gave humans the Earth to cultivate, not conquer. It's also the first entirely written by Francis. In a nod to his namesake, St. Francis, the Pope has titled his upcoming encyclical "Laudato Si." The archaic Italian phrase, which means "Be praised," is borrowed from the patron saint of ecology's 13th-century song, "Canticle of the Sun." Months before its publication, the encyclical has drawn criticism from conservatives and climate change skeptics, who urged the Pope not to put his moral weight behind such a controversial cause. Pope, GOP collide on climate change From the first days of his papacy, Francis has preached about the importance of the environment, not only as a scientific concern but also a moral one. In his first homily as pontiff, Francis called six times during the short sermon for humans to protect creation. Vatican advisers have said "Laudato Si" will not be a white paper delving deeply into policy prescriptions. But neither is Francis likely to ignore the opinion of most scientists about how human activities contribute to climate change. 5 key questions about the Pope and climate change  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Defying skeptics, Shenzhen's start-ups aim to stay - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Not long ago, Shenzhen's start-up community was fighting for attention. Now it has a thriving scene of small companies investing in hardware. </descricao>
            <corpo>Shenzhen, China (CNN)Soon after computer engineer Terry Ouyang finished university, he found there was plenty of work with industry behemoths such as IBM. But it wasn't long before he ditched the corporate ladder to make hardware on his own terms. "Our generation's motivation is different," Ouyang told CNN. "Our parents were focused on making a living. But we want to do interesting and original things. Instead of making things for other companies, we want to make things ourselves." Just a few short years ago, Shenzhen's start-up community was fighting for attention. Today, this sprawling city of over 10 million -- which lies just north of Hong Kong, across the border with mainland China -- is home to big names like Huawei, as well as a thriving scene of small companies. A select few of which have attracted major investors and global consumers, from robot kit maker Makeblock to drone maker DJI. Is this Chinese drone maker worth $10 billion? In recent years, Shenzhen's hardware entrepreneurs have faced skeptics who say real entrepreneurial energy can't flourish in a country such as China. They say while it is evolving economically, it still struggles to protect companies from intellectual property theft, and retains a closed political system. Yet, the government has publicly declared that it supports entrepreneurs, while "maker" communities and incubators are sprouting up across China. Ouyang, 31, is one of the administrators of SZDIY (Shenzhen Do-It-Yourself) a member's association that meets in an old industrial building and builds everything from vehicles to games. The workshop is a study of contrasts: at once dusty and hi-tech. "Our goal at SZDIY is to find like-minded engineers and others who are really passionate about making things," says Ouyang. But he tempers his enthusiasm with a dose of reality. Despite the attention they've received, the Shenzhen start-up community is still a minnow in China, given the country's size. "The people who have the mindset of a maker is a very small group," he says. "It's easy to start a company in Shenzhen. But we need time to fail and to learn from mistakes. Also, the engineers and the designers don't talk to each other enough."  Cyril Ebersweiler, the 36-year-old founder and managing director of Haxlr8r -- a Shenzhen-based hardware start-up accelerator -- says it makes sense that entrepreneurs are flocking in ever-greater numbers to the epicenter of the world's electronics manufacturing, despite any uncertainties about China's socio-political evolution. "Entrepreneurs need to be in the right ecosystems at the right time," says Ebersweiler. "For fundraising, you go to Silicon Valley. For hardware and manufacturing, you come to Shenzhen." It also helps that Shenzhen is home to Huaqiang Electronics World -- a massive components emporium where, day-in. day-out traders sell the circuit boards, LEDs, bolts and screws that go into the world's electronic gadgets. Originally from France, Ebersweiler has worked in Asia for over a decade. Haxlr8r acts as an early investor for a range of hardware start-ups from all over the world, which apply for a spot in Haxlr8r's program. They invite the companies to their loft in Shenzhen for 111 days of intense prototype development and refinement. Then it's off to the U.S. to meet potential investors and impress the media. "This is only the very beginning of the battle," he says. "What the companies do here is only an indication of what's next. The biggest challenge is fear. And today there is enormous pressure. Everyone expects Apple-level quality." As for fears of intellectual property theft, some say China's pirated goods purveyors -- collectively known as "shanzhai" -- are actually bringing benefits to the hardware start-up community. "It's interesting, the shanzhai are getting to a level of quality that's actually helping us," says Ebersweiler. "If you go to the market and take a look at shanzhai products, if you look at the finishing -- some of it is incredible. We learn from their cost-saving techniques."  Hong Kong also has a batch of recently launched accelerators, though the former British colony is lacking the major benefit of Shenzhen, which is the proximity to parts suppliers and some of the world's most experienced factories. Brinc, which also has offices in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, is a Hong Kong-headquartered accelerator focusing on IoT -- or, the 'Internet of Things' -- hardware. Brinc gives its companies an introduction to factories in China, and helps with crowdfunding campaigns and distribution launches. "Hong Kong has a fantastic banking system, (a) very strong litigation system, and it has an ecosystem of local service providers that help with branding and registering IP," says Manav Gupta, 30, CEO of Brinc. "If you decide to do some of this in Shenzhen, it's a little more challenging -- understanding who to talk to, understanding the psyche of doing business in China. We provide a service backbone to our companies so they can plug in when they go to China." Soundbrenner, a company founded in Germany and invested in by Brinc, makes what it calls the world's first wearable metronome for musicians, which they are anticipating will go on sale by the end of the year. "Coming from Berlin, the biggest problem building our product in China was finding reliable partners because we had never manufactured anything before," says Florian Simmendinger, the 26-year-old Soundbrenner CEO. "The second problem was the communication barrier -- which we solved with a very good Chinese project manager. And the third problem was the cultural differences, the way you solve problems and the quality of execution in each phase, which we successfully overcame to leverage as opportunities in doing business in China." For now, change is accelerating for Shenzhen's entrepreneurs, despite China's significant growth challenges. "In the past few years, the mindset has changed," says Ebersweiler. "Manufacturers are willing to give something new a shot. Until recently, factories weren't willing to take anything less than an order of 100,000 units. Some big factories are now willing to take a punt, especially since we've been around for a while."  </corpo>

            <descricao>An apartment balcony near UC Berkeley collapsed Tuesday, killing six people at a birthday party attended by Irish students, officials said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)An apartment balcony collapsed during a birthday party attended by Irish students in the California city of Berkeley early Tuesday, killing six of the 13 people who fell from the fourth-floor structure, officials said. Three men and three women in their early 20s died following the collapse, officials told reporters. Five of the victims were from Ireland and one was from California, said Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff's Department. Those Irish citizens who fell from the balcony at the Library Gardens Apartments were students with short-term work visas, gathered in an apartment to celebrate someone's 21st birthday, Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said earlier. At an afternoon news conference, Nelson released their names: Olivia Burke, 21; Eimear Walsh, 21; Eoghan Culligan, 21; Niccolai Schuster, 21; and Lorcan Miller, 21. Ashley Donohoe, 22, from Rohnert Park, California, was also killed. Besides those who died, at least seven were taken to hospitals with serious injuries after the balcony gave way at about 12:40 a.m., Berkeley police Officer Byron White told CNN. Three victims went to Highland Hospital in Oakland, but officials there said it doesn't have permission to release the conditions of the two women and a man. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the balcony to collapse, Berkeley police spokeswoman Jennifer Coats said. The balcony appeared to have torn away from the rest of the building. Hours after the collapse, the fourth-floor railing -- its base gone -- was resting upside down on the railing of the balcony below, video from CNN affiliate KGO showed. Among the debris on the ground: Smashed pieces of the balcony's concrete floor, a plastic cup and a shoe. The students were among hundreds of Irish young adults who are working in Berkeley on J-1 visas for the summer, Mark Neville told CNN affiliate KGO. Neville, one of the visa holders, said he is staying in the apartment complex, but that he wasn't at the party and didn't know those who were there. He said he was sleeping in a first-floor unit when he "heard a loud bang." "I went out to get a friend, and I just saw the place (outside) was covered in rubble," Neville told KGO. "Bodies had been taken away in ambulances. It was tough to see." At least one person phoned 911 about the birthday to report a noise complaint, but officers didn't go to the building because there were shootings in the area that took priority, Police Chief Michael Meehan said. When 911 calls poured in after the collapse, officers were on scene in 2 minutes, he said. Philip Grant, Ireland's consul general to the Western United States said the first flights carrying relatives of the victims will arrive Tuesday night. Government officials in both Ireland and the United States reacted with sorrow. "We mourn the tragic loss of young lives in California this morning," Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny posted on Twitter on Tuesday. The U.S. ambassador to Ireland, Kevin O'Malley, released a statement offering his sympathy to the relatives and friends of those who died. Flanagan offered his condolences to the victims' relatives in a statement released by his office. He said his department would provide consular assistance to the Irish citizens involved. Irish President Michael Higgins expressed "greatest sadness," saying he learned of the incident while on an official visit to Italy. "My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of all those involved," Higgins said. The apartment is about three blocks from the University of California-Berkeley. The school didn't immediately know if any of the students were affiliated with it, university representative Roqua Montez said. Other balconies at the complex have been "red tagged" and the building owner has been ordered to inspect them, officials said. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo, Sam Stringer, Steve Almasy, Laura Smith-Spark and Sheena Jones contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>Traders highlights the business of global trading by showcasing extraordinary individuals worldwide who are trading goods and services across borders. Toledo, Spain (CNN)The sweet sounds of Spanish guitars have serenaded music lovers for hundreds of years, reaching audiences far beyond their home country. But now one company wants to move the music back to its roots. Based in the foothills outside Toledo, Spain, Manuel Rodriguez guitars are exported all over the world -- inspiring Flamenco music in Japan and sounding out Latin styles in South America. They are exported to 120 countries and are played by musicians including Carlos Santana and Stevie Wonder. At the moment most of the 15,000 guitars they make annually are industrially produced in China, where they are assembled in one month and sold for around $200. But each year, 5,000 guitars are also made in Spain, crafted from a variety of woods such as African ebony, Canadian cedar and Indian rosewood. These models can fetch up to $20,000 each. "A $20,000 guitar would take about three to four months -- so you put so much passion, love in that instrument you feel ashamed to sell it," says Manuel Rodriguez, the third generation owner of the company. He says his is the second-oldest guitar brand in the world, and now he plans to bring the production of its low-price guitars back from China to their historic home of Spain. "People will buy more our instruments made in Spain than made in China," says Rodriguez. "In China the labor is going up, so it's going be difficult to compete and I think that's our next challenge is to express and to show the Spanish guitar is back in Spain."

            <corpo> (CNN)Tough, strong and noble; these are the sorts of qualities one would expect from a national symbol. The fabled Karabakh horse is a rare and beautiful animal that is of great importance to Azerbaijanis. But the country's national animal that can be found everywhere from its stories to its postage stamps is faced with extinction. In the thickly forested foothills of Sheki, a small city 300km (187 miles) from the capital Baku, is one of world's largest and purest Karabakh herds. Their owner, Yashar Guluzade, has been restoring the breed for over a decade in this unspoilt mountainous region. He says that conflict and a difficult economic situation have led to their decline. "At the beginning of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict the horses were continually transferred from one place to another and this was one of the reasons for the sharp reduction of stock as the movement of pregnant mares led to miscarriages," he explained. Guluzade says that the places the horses were taken did not have the correct conditions and pastures to support them and it was as if the country had forgotten about them. The government has now stepped in to try and protect the breed. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Agriculture has drawn up a number of horse breeding programs and the law states the animal cannot be exported for sale. The ministry says it may consider selling the horses in the future to raise money for their upkeep but for now the focus is on breeding and protection. Khandan Rajabli, the managing director of the ministry's breeding division told CNN that these programs include improving veterinary services, training and scientific studies on the horses' DNA. "Instituting a system of identification like passports to track the breed has been established" he said. Rajabli says that a German company is also assisting with gene research and establishing the horses genetic profiling so a system can be developed to confirm the breed in future. German horse breeder, Verena Scholian, is one of the experts that have been working with the Azerbaijani government, advising them on breeding programs and technical equipment. Scholian, who has spent decades researching the Karabakh's blood-line, says it's easy to see the horses appeal. "I love handling them; they are calm, friendly and very sure footed," she said. Estimates on the number of Karabakh horses vary. According to the Karabakh Foundation, there are less than 1,000, but Scholian believes there could be less than 10 mares that are one-half pure bred. The mountain-steppe racing horse is named after the geographical region where it was originally developed. The Karabakh horse is the result of cross-breeding and stands out with what's been described as its "golden glow." The horses are also known for their exceptional speed. The Karabakh foundation says that in 2004, a horse from the Agdam region set a world record; running 1,000 meters in 1 minute and 9 seconds. The foundation's chair, Dr. Adil Baguirov, originally from the Karabakh region, says the horse has always been important to Azerbaijani's. "Azerbaijanis are Turkic people who until a few centuries ago enjoyed a semi-nomadic lifestyle, especially in the Karabakh region, which is lush with grass and has perfect pastures," he said. "Even as late as the 19th century, a sizable portion of Azerbaijanis, particularly in the Karabakh region, lived in mountains in the summer and in lowlands in the winter," he continued. Baguirov explains that it was the horses ability to handle mountainous and rugged terrain that deemed them an essential part of life. These days Scholian says the horses are mainly used for racing and as a status symbol for the rich. Guluzade currently has 35 pure bred Karabakh horses on his farm. He says he will continue to breed them because he is worried about their future. "My strategy for breeding was built on the premise that each pure bred mare should leave behind one offspring, preferably a mare," he said. "I will continue my work in this direction where others have been irresponsible in the past," he continued. The century-old breed is said to have incredible endurance and strength, qualities that Azerbaijani's hope will see the animals fight off extinction. "The Karabakh horses are a symbol of national heritage and pride. It's an ancient, national breed that is inseparable from our national identity," Rajabli said.

            <corpo>(CNN)In a still publicly unacknowledged incident, a Russian military surveillance aircraft flew close to four NATO warships in the Baltic Sea on Thursday, including the destroyer USS Jason Dunham, which captured video of the incident, a U.S. Defense Department official said Saturday. The Pentagon has not released the video. The Russian plane was a Russian Maritime Patrol aircraft, similar to the U.S. P8. The official said the Dunham was part of a four-ship group that also included British, French and German warships. At one point, the Russian aircraft flew above the deck of one of the NATO ships at an altitude of just 500 feet. RELATED: U.S., Russian aircraft came within 10 feet over Black Sea "We are not calling this safe and professional. We are calling it routine, but we are on the edge of being very uncomfortable," the official said. The official added that none of the warships felt directly threatened by the Russian overflight, but the flight was "lower and closer" than the U.S. had routinely seen. Since the last several recent encounters with Russian aircraft, the U.S. European Command is taking extra steps to ensure all ships and air crews are equipped with video gear.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>9 Inspiring Instagram accounts from the silk Road  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>We take a look at some of the most breathtaking Instragram accounts from the Silk Road travelers' trail.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Winding its way roughly from China in the east, all the way to Italy in the west, the Silk Road has captured the imagination of travelers for centuries. Though to call it a single road is a little misleading -- it's actually a series of ancient trade routes stretching like veins across the globe. Encompassing an astonishing breadth of cultures, cuisines, and landscapes -- from the exquisite craftsmanship of Xi'an's terracotta army, to the gasp-enducing horsemanship of rural Kyrgyzstan, and the futuristic architecture of Astana -- it's little wonder travelers are still packing their bags for this colorful trail. We take a look at some of the best Instagram accounts from the region. Get ready for some serious travel envy.  Who: Yeatoeh Lhamo Penjore, 24-year-old teacher and part-time fitness model from Bhutan. My journey: Ever since the 4th grade I have been studying outside of Bhutan (India, New York, Singapore) so I suppose my love for travel and other cultures is because of that. Also, since I was out of my own country for so long I realized Bhutan has so much beauty. I enjoy taking pictures of Bhutan. Top Instagram tip: If you are passionate about what you do, your photos generally do the speaking.  Who: Thien Bui, 29-year-old Australian, previously working in the financial sector and currently taking a belated gap year to travel the world. My journey: I've been traveling for over a year now, starting my Silk Road adventure in Bishek, Kyrgyszstan. From there, I traveled over land through central Asia, Iran and Europe. I'm currently taking a break from traveling so I may work on a fresh itinerary exploring foreign lands. My plan is to hit the road again come July. Top Instagram tip: Forgo the selfie stick and point the camera the other way! On a more serious note, I approach my Instagram photos the same way I would with any photo -- thinking of composition, light, shadows and trying to capture the unique moments in my travels.  Who: Francesco Dominick Arbolino, 32-year-old American, currently full-time traveler. My journey: I've spent six months on this trip so far, but I have spent over four years traveling, having visited 88 countries. On this particular trip, I've visited Indonesia, Timor Leste, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. I'm motivated mostly by curiosity about countries that most people don't travel to. I also have a strong desire to interact with locals. I find this easier in less-touristy places. Top Instagram tip: If you like photographing architecture or landscapes, head out at sunrise for beautiful golden light and not many people to interfere with the composition. If photographing people is your passion, start shooting about an hour before sunset when many people are still on the streets and that golden light reappears.  Who: Sanjit Das, 39-year-old Indian photographer based between Malaysia and India. My journey: I am currently working on a photographic project documenting one river that crosses three countries - China, India and Bangladesh. It's an attempt to see how a river can influences cultures. Top Instagram tip: 1. Don't bombard your followers. 2. Give relevant information with what you're posting. People like to know what you sharing with them.  Who: Stefen Chow, 35-year-old professional photographer born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, and now based in Beijing. My journey: I travel constantly -- around 100 flights per year -- though not too long that I miss my family terribly. I travel mainly for work and for my project: www.thepovertyline.net. Top Instagram tip: Be honest and who you are. I take pictures only when it inspires me personally.  Who: Jethro Mullen, 36, CNN.com journalist based in Hong Kong and focusing on news in the Asia-Pacific region. My journey: I moved from Europe to Hong Kong about five years ago and have loved exploring different parts of Asia, including Cambodia, Vietnam and Japan. Top Instagram tip: Get lost. Often the most interesting pictures are the ones you stumble across by chance.  Who: Alejandra Wilkinson , 27-year-old English-Venezuelan working in marketing in Hong Kong. My journey: Traveling and learning about new cultures has been part of my upbringing, as my father was always being moved around for work, so I love exploring new places -- and particularly different cuisines! Wherever I go traveling, I like to pick places where I know the food is going to be excellent. Top Instagram tip: Use a filter that's going to make it look cool, but that doesn't distort it too much from reality - if it looked good enough to take a picture of it in the first place, it'll look good even without a filter.  Who: Theodore Kaye, 34-year-old Taiwanese-American photographer. My journey: I travel on assignments mostly in east and central Asia, and have a long running interest in the post-Soviet "stans." Top Instagram tip: Mobile photography can help capture telling moments in daily life that we might not shoot - or share - otherwise.  Who: Will Kernick, 21-year-old British student and mountaineer. My Journey: I have spent the last three years traveling as frequently as possible to both Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. I am hoping to complete the formidable Snow Leopard Award (climbing the five 7,000 meter mountains in the former Soviet Union). Only a handful of westerners have climbed all five, and it is my ambition to become both the youngest ever and the first British person to do so. Top Instagram Tip: I am very new to this game, but you can't go wrong if you only attach your very best pictures that are particularly visually spectacular.  </corpo>

            <descricao>The husbands of British sisters who have gone missing with their kids plead tearfully for their families to come home amid fears they have headed to Syria.</descricao>
            <corpo>Bradford, England (CNN)The husbands of British sisters who have gone missing with their children pleaded tearfully Tuesday for their families to come home amid fears they have headed to Syria, which is ravaged by terrorism and war. "You know, Mariya, I love you. I don't know what to say," said Akhtar Iqbal, the husband of Sugra Dawood, addressing his young daughter at a televised press conference in Britain. "I'm shaking and I miss you. It's been too many days. I don't where you are. Please come back home." Then he teared up as he addressed his whole family, "I miss you, I love you, all of you. I love you a lot. I can't live without you. Please, please call me. " Three sisters and their nine children from northern England disappeared while on a trip to the Middle East. The husbands of two of the sisters appealed for help in tracking the family down amid concerns the sisters could be trying to join a brother in Syria. "Please contact me," Mohammad Shoaib begged his wife, Khadija Dawood, at the press conference. "I am not angry. ... They are young kids, 7 and 5. And you know I love you so much." The husband of the third sister did not appear, as he is not in the UK. Balaal Khan, a lawyer acting for the Dawood family, said the three missing women and their children, ages 3 to 15, had traveled to Saudi Arabia on an Islamic pilgrimage on May 28. But instead of returning home to the city of Bradford, in northern England, as expected Thursday, they disappeared. They have not been in touch since June 9, and their cell phones have not been active, either. Nor have their social media profiles been updated in the past week, the statement said. The sisters have been named as Khadija Dawood, Sugra Dawood and Zohra Dawood, all in their 30s. Khadija Dawood's two children are Maryam Siddiqui, 7, and Muhammad Haseeb, 5; Sugra Dawood's five children are Junaid Ahmed Iqbal, Ibrahim Iqbal, Zaynab Iqbal, Mariya Iqbal and Ismaeel Iqbal, ages 15 to 3; and Zohra Dawood's two children are Haafiyah Binte Zubair, 8, and Nurah Binte Zubair, 5. Khan, the lawyer, said all 12 boarded a flight from Medina, Saudi Arabia, to Istanbul on June 9. Early reports that two of the children failed to board the plane were wrong, he said. The lawyer told journalists that there were no family problems and the husbands had no clue their wives were about to disappear. The families practice a moderate version of Islam, and there had been no indications of radicalization, he said. He said that a trip to Syria was only one possible theory for the family's disappearance. But he mentioned, as well, that there were concerns about how the women had been able to buy tickets from Saudi Arabia to Turkey.  The brother of the three missing women is already in Syria, Naz Shah, a member of Parliament from the Bradford area, told CNN. And that is why the family is so concerned about the whereabouts of the missing women and their children, she said. Shah added that she has "never heard of anything remotely like this in Bradford before." Turkey has become a popular transit route for people seeking to reach Syria, where ISIS and other opposition groups have been battling the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Another local Bradford member of Parliament, Imran Hussain, has asked Britain's Foreign Office to help find the family. The Foreign Office said: "We are in contact with West Yorkshire police and Turkish authorities and are ready to provide consular assistance."  The Dawood family reported the women and children's disappearance to police after they failed to return as expected. Officers are investigating their whereabouts and are "working extensively with authorities overseas to try and locate them," a statement from West Yorkshire police said. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster said: "We are extremely concerned for the safety of the family and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. "Our priority is for their safe return; their families are gravely worried about them and want them home. One of our primary concerns is the safety and welfare of the young children." News of the Dawoods' disappearance came shortly after family members of a teenage boy from West Yorkshire said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS released a photo showing the 17-year-old in front of an ISIS black flag. There are fears the boy, Talha Asmal from Dewsbury, may have been involved in ISIS suicide attacks near the Iraqi city of Baiji. Other teens have also been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left the country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport. CNN's Nic Robertson and Bharati Naik reported from Bradford, while Laura Smith-Spark and CNN's Don Melvin wrote from London. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Magna Carta: Still relevant 800 years on - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Magna Carta was sealed on June 15, 1215 under title of "Great Charter." Core values set out by Magna Carta remain at the heart of Britain's constitution.</descricao>
            <corpo>John Stanton is a lecturer at City Law School at City University London. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. (CNN)Around 20 miles from central London, where modern-day government and democracy shape the lives of citizens throughout the United Kingdom, the Thames meanders peacefully through nondescript English countryside. This is just another part of the green and pleasant land that has come to define much of these shores. Except that there's something rather different about this rural corner of England. These riverside fields at Runnymede are reputed to be the setting for one of the most significant moments in UK democratic and constitutional history. The National Trust labels it "the birthplace of modern democracy," while an impressive monument commemorates a "symbol of freedom under law." It was here, of course, that the Magna Carta is said to have been sealed on June 15, 1215 under the title of the "Great Charter." The catalyst for Magna Carta was the tyrannical rule of King John and, in particular, his imposition of arbitrary taxes upon the barons. The sealing of Magna Carta marked the first time that the notion that an unelected sovereign should be restrained under law was officially recognized. From then on, the idea that citizens should not be subjected to the arbitrary rule of a tyrannical monarch but instead be ruled and governed upon foundations of accepted legal process and law had a legal foundation. This was, in essence, an evolution of the Aristotlean idea of the supremacy of law in preference to the supremacy of man. Such a concept is today known as the rule of law and Magna Carta is widely accepted as being the birth of such rule in the UK constitution. So, a big moment. Of course, understandings of the rule of law have altered and developed from that determined by King John's subjection. Theorists and academics have, over the centuries, debated and set out contrasting views as to what Magna Carta means in practice. Adherence to the rule of law is now believed to demand more than due legal process in preference to arbitrary rule. It now (for example) demands the equal subjection of all people -- whatever their rank or position -- to the ordinary law of the land; the appreciation and protection of individual rights and liberties and the ultimate ability of all citizens to be able to conduct themselves freely in a system guided by law and legal principle.  To say that the modern UK constitution is one that adheres to the basic principles of the rule of law is to state the obvious. That said, the UK constitutional system is markedly different from that which prevailed in the early 13th century. Monarchical legal power is virtually, if not completely, non-existent. Legislative and executive functions are in a sense fused through an institution built upon democracy and universal adult suffrage. The needs of citizens are fundamentally more diverse and complex than they were 800 years ago. Consequently, the system involves a great deal more discretionary authority than traditional rule of law theorists might find acceptable. As well as this, competing interests and concerns of the state often demand difficult balances and compromises to be struck between pressing political matters and concerns on the one hand, and individual liberties and core values of due process on the other. Even these occurrences are carefully regulated and debated as part of a constitutional system that, while highly peculiar, is adaptable and flexible to the constantly shifting needs and concerns of society. The core values set out by the Magna Carta, therefore -- due legal process over arbitrary power and the freedom to act within a system guided by legal principle -- are still very much at the heart of our constitution, even if that system has evolved and changed beyond all recognition. Over the centuries most of the Great Charter's clauses have been repealed. Only three of the original 63 clauses remain in force: those providing for the freedom of the Church of England; the protection of the liberties and free customs of the City of London; and the protection of individuals from imprisonment or punishment without due process. But the legacy of Magna Carta runs much deeper. The establishment of the rule of law at Runnymede 800 years ago went on to inspire and shape the development of the UK constitution and, indeed, the constitutions of democratic systems the world over.

            <descricao>Drones, remote tech and aircraft cabins of the future on the agenda at major aviation industry event</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)As the world's oldest and largest air show, the Paris Air Show is the undisputed queen of its kind. The tarmac of Paris-Le Bourget Airport is set, once again, to be heaving with manufacturers, military representatives, businessmen and the general public from across the globe. So what will the 51st edition of the biannual spectacle, which runs June 15-21, have in store? Here are five key trends I believe are likely to take center stage.  The link between air connectivity and global economic growth is profound, so it's no surprise to see the emerging economies of the world -- and those with fast growing middle classes -- experiencing the highest demand for aircraft and aerospace infrastructure. Asia is booming. The region is expected to represent two thirds of global aviation sector growth by 2034, so observers expect a flurry of orders from its airlines at Le Bourget. While such rapid regional growth is sensational to watch from the sidelines, there are a number of practical considerations for those supporting larger fleets of aircraft. Although the bulk of orders are coming from newer Asian markets, the infrastructure to support them is still mainly in Europe and North America. Maintenance, repair and overhaul support cannot operate effectively from a distance, particularly for short-haul aircraft that dominate the market by volume -- it has to be local. The development of regional hub networks is a crucial factor for expansion into these highly profitable regions, opening up opportunities to new players in the market. Maintenance of aircraft is one thing, but planes also have to be able to take off and land somewhere. The rapid population growth across Asian countries far surpasses the speed of the airport infrastructure development required to support it. In fact, the number of airports per million people in Asia represents a fraction of 1% -- far lower than in the West. Airport development and access to airports has to match and keep pace with population growth -- this is a much greater restriction on the region's development than the availability of aircraft. The logistics of this, and the need to provide sufficient airport infrastructure across the region, will be a major discussion point.  The Internet of Things isn't a new concept for the aviation industry. Sensors and digital automation have been common features within manufacturing and the operation of machinery for more than a decade. In recent years the surge of new and powerful technologies has opened commercial possibilities for aerospace and defense companies. One area evolving rapidly is technology that enables engineers to check on the performance of every mechanical component on board a plane. In the wake of the last year's spate of aircraft losses, renewed focus has been placed in this area. However, there's more work to be done before real time health monitoring from the skies becomes commonplace. I expect to see a plethora of companies working to push us closer toward comprehensive inflight monitoring and direct communication between aircraft sensors and operations on the ground. Within the next five years or so, I'd expect significantly more ground staff to have access to a constant stream of information, giving them continual and complete understanding of an aircraft's performance. What could this mean for the future? Were an engine to develop issues midair, could it be possible for a standby system to kick in and run crucial systems from the ground, enabling the flight to continue safely? The security and legal ramifications of remote operation are yet to be ironed out, and there are ongoing issues with bandwidth, but this is the direction the industry is moving. We'll likely see major technological developments from players at the cutting edge of this market at Le Bourget this year.  The mobile revolution has put a smart device in the hands of almost every airline passenger -- we expect to be online at all times. But only a fraction of air passengers can access the Internet. There's a huge drive to change this as airlines battle for "connected customers." Plans to roll out further "connected routes," especially on long haul flights, will certainly be on the agenda in Paris. I predict innovations around increasing bandwidth and in security -- an area that developers will be keen to address, as inflight connectivity invariably opens the door for potential hackers. Developments don't stop here. The notion of the connected flier brings with it a new technological trend: the integration of connected devices with the aircraft itself. This could be through phone or tablet apps that allow passengers to order food and drink, control inflight entertainment and adjust the lighting around their seat.  Aerospace interiors is a huge, exciting and innovative marketplace. Companies big and small are drawing inspiration from other areas, such as the automotive industry, to tackle a whole range of pain point issues in the aircraft cabin. We'll see a glimpse into the future of the cabin experience, as companies showcase solutions to issues of privacy and personal space, seat density, weight reduction and cabin ambiance. Airlines are under increased pressure to drive down cost and boost capacity while improving their share of the lucrative first- and business-class passenger groups. The trend for the likes of the Gulf carriers to adopt more advanced and luxurious options for upmarket passengers is set to continue. At the other end of the spectrum, ongoing demand for low-cost air travel will focus airlines on the clever use of space and weight distribution to accommodate extra seating. Between these two polar extremes of consumer travel, there's a growing trend toward using aircraft interiors to develop more intermediate classes. There's talk of the traditional three (first, business, economy) being expanded to five with the addition of two more premium economy options. Proposals for these will likely be on display at the Paris Air Show.  Drones and Unmanned Air Systems will continue to be a huge area -- the UAS market is possibly the fastest growing area in the aerospace and defense industries. What's so astonishing about this area is the breadth of its influence. In recent years the market has expanded from monitoring and bombing activity in war zones, to disaster relief efforts (most recently in the wake of the earthquake in Nepal), aircraft inspection for maintenance and the delivery of parcels. The technology, which will be on display in abundance at Le Bourget, is already mature, so the discussion is likely to focus on challenges surrounding its application, for example airspace access. The perceived lack of control and subsequent security issues in this domain have been demonstrated by recent near misses between drones and commercial aircraft, particularly in and around airports.

            <descricao>On June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, will welcome some 6,000 athletes.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into countries around the world. This time we travel to Azerbaijan in the lead up to the European Games to explore the culture of sports in the country sitting on the Caspian Sea. (CNN)This month marks the start of a new era: on June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, will welcome some 6,000 athletes to this inaugural sporting festival. The Games, which will take place every four years, were brought into being at a vote by members of the European Olympic Committee (EOC) in 2012 and announced at a meeting of the body's General Assembly in Rome that December. Thirty-eight of the 49 EOC members backed the Games, which provide a European equivalent of the multi-sport Asian Games and the Pan-American Games, both of which have been part of the calendar since 1951. Representatives of 50 European nations will compete, with the opening ceremony taking place on Friday June 12th and the closing ceremony being held on Sunday 28th. The committee said the event "is in no way intended to be a copy of the Olympic Games" and is "a tool with which to enhance the attractiveness of sport." Which sports are being showcased? The new Games will play host to some new disciplines after the Olympic Committee made its selection from an "overwhelming" number of suggestions. Twenty sports will be on the agenda -- 16 Olympic events and the other four making their debuts in this format. First, the familiar ones: aquatics, archery, athletics, badminton, judo, volleyball, boxing, canoe, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo, triathlon and wrestling will all be there. And what of the newcomers? Well, they're 3x3 basketball, karate, beach soccer and sambo. The first three are self-explanatory -- but what exactly is sambo? And how do you do it? Sambo has its roots in the military history of the Soviet Union, of which Azerbaijan was a part. A martial art, it was devised as an element of Red Army training in the 1920s with the intention of sharpening soldiers' hand-to-hand combat skills. Throwing, groundwork and submissions are all elements -- the sport has echoes of both wrestling and judo, but rules and restrictions are different -- and the name is a truncated version of the Russian for 'self-defence without weapons.' We can probably expect Russia to do well in this one. What are the incentives for athletes? They are twofold: both the winning of medals for their country and opportunities to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Baku will host 253 medal events, with direct Olympic qualification at stake in disciplines including the triathlon. What do we know about Baku? We know there had been initial thoughts that Russia and Turkey would be in contention to be host nation -- but Azerbaijan was the only bidder, and Baku, with a population of around 2.5 million, takes its place in the spotlight. The city, the largest in the South Caucasus and the biggest on the shores of the Caspian Sea, mixes the influences of east and west and, at the heart of an oil-rich nation, has plenty of conspicuous wealth: there are gleaming office towers and the boulevards at its center are home to high-end shops. Look beyond the shininess, though, and you'll find the true heart of the place -- the walled Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has its origins in the 12th century, while lush green promenades wind around the coastline. What does Azerbaijan hope to gain from hosting the Games? Azerbaijan wants to put itself and its capital at center stage, with sports minister Azad Rahimov saying in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: "The main important thing is to position our country on the map of the world and our country on the map of Europe. "The best instrument to do that is sport and culture. Sport has a bigger potential for reaching the most people." The Netherlands is set to host the second European Games, which will take place in 2019.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Hu Bing: exporting British style to China - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>As its first international style ambassador, Hu will champion British fashion in his homeland and beyond.</descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)It's the final day of men's fashion week in London, and a crowd has gathered inside the Old Sorting Office, a former industrial site, to watch models work the runway. Dylan Jones, the editor of style bible GQ, sits on the front row, just a few seats down from David Gandy, one of the world's most sought-after male models, perhaps most recognized when wearing only a pair of briefs. Yet among the British fashion-savvy, it's a Chinese celebrity who turns the most heads. Wearing golden sneakers and a white suit, Hu Bing carries himself with the confidence and grace you'd expect from China's top male model, who just happens to be a former Olympic rower, a part-time singer and one of China's best-known actors. Hu, now 45, has worked for Cartier, Dunhill, Gucci, and Ferragamo, among others, and now he's working for the British Fashion Council (BFC) — the body that promotes British fashion internationally. As its first international style ambassador, Hu will champion British fashion in his homeland and beyond. "The Chinese like British brands, but they don't say 'British fashion,'" he says. "They just say 'European fashion.' Sometimes they mix up London, Paris, and Milan, when the fashion is all totally different." Indeed, Hu has a challenge on his hands. In the most recent World Luxury Index, French and Italian fashion brands, led by Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Gucci, dominated the list of the most sought-after luxury fashion labels in China. Burberry was the only British brand in the Top 10. "I need to do a lot of work," Hu says. "I have a responsibility to present London fashion as London fashion." He knows that London has a reputation for the tailoring of Saville Row and the timeless Burberry trench coat, but Hu believes the USP of British fashion comes from its whimsy. "London is more easygoing and more fun," he says. "Designers are more afraid in Asia — and in New York and Paris. But in London people really just enjoy themselves. They feel confidant. That is the difference." "I've been to many different cities for Fashion Week — Milan, Paris, New York City. But London is the most amazing city for me right now. In five years I want London Fashion Week to be number one."  Like a model balancing in her stilettos, luxury brands in China occasionally wobble. In 2014 the once bullish Chinese luxury market posted its first year of negative growth, shrinking by 1% according to Bain &amp; Co. And in the year leading to April 2015, Prada closed 16 stores in China, while Armani shut five. China's economy may be slowing down, but the British Fashion Council have still made a clever play by drafting Hu as its suited and booted fashion envoy. Despite the broader picture, sales of menswear in China actually climbed 7% last year, according to Euromonitor, and menswear now accounts for a larger chunk of apparel sales than womenswear. Euromonitor forecasts that China — currently the fifth largest market for luxury menswear globally — will climb to second, behind the United States, by 2017. The number of Chinese press and buyers attending men's fashion week (officially known as London Collections: Men) has nearly doubled since the first showcase in 2012. The market slant towards menswear is driven partly by China's "One-Child Policy" and cultural values that stress the primacy of men over women. Chinese men are increasingly concerned with image and, owing to rising incomes, more likely to trade up the fashion ladder. Hu also sees it as a matter of playing catch-up with China's women. "In China, the lady's closet is almost full," he says. "But men, before they had no clothes, so now they need to buy a lot. They want to dress up and shine."  And when they do, the British Fashion Council is betting that China's men will look to Hu for inspiration. After all: he has 10 million followers on China's microblogging site Weibo. "We are thrilled that Hu Bing has become an International Ambassador for London Collections Men, as his enormous influence, knowledge of the Chinese market and enthusiasm for fashion makes him a perfect choice," Dylan Jones, the chair of LCM, said when announcing the selection earlier this spring. "Having an International Ambassador in China is key to the development of London Collections Men." As part of that development, Hu will educate British fashion houses about the immense and varied Chinese market and counter what he sees as bizarre stereotypes. "I'm here in Europe and I'm surprised that everybody is saying that Chinese people are too serious and not funny," he says. "It's not true. Chinese are interested in new things, and are traveling everywhere in the world." Their bold, international tastes come through in the Chinese designers showing in London. You can't call them pedestrian. Take designer Sean Suen, who, on June 15, sent male models down the runway wearing high-fashion aprons and metallic, open-toed sandals. Hu says that the smartest brands won't try their luck when opening new stores, but will invest the time to conduct longer searches. "You need to know the real China," he says, pointing out that what's "real" changes with the wind. "Every three months you need to update your marketing information. Things happen too fast in China." He also points out that just as fashion varies from London to Paris to Milan, it also varies within China's biggest fashion hubs Shanghai and Beijing. Hu says Shanghai is comparable Tokyo, where people are more likely to keep it simple and conform, while Beijing is akin to anything-goes New York. "In Shanghai, the look is really Japanese. They like to do one thing. It's never four, five, or six. But in Beijing it's like one to ten — it's total freedom."   </corpo>

            <descricao>Imagine a city where the waters rise, eight people are killed, and wild animals roam the streets. That was the case in Tblisi, the capital of Georgia.
</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Wild animals roamed the streets of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on Sunday, after raging floodwaters damaged the city's zoo and set many of the animals free. Twelve people died in the flooding, according to Civil Georgia, a news website run by the nongovernmental organization UN Association of Georgia. Several others were missing, and wolves, bears, big cats and even a hippopotamus were wandering the streets of the city, according to Civil.ge, a news agency funded by the EU and the UN. Of the zoo's 600 residents, including fish and birds, about half were missing on Sunday, theTbilisi Zoo said. Some animals have been recaptured, Civil.ge reported. Others have been killed.  But some animals were still roaming loose. Video from the city shows what appears to be a crocodile slithering down the city streets, as well as a hippopotamus standing around looking confused. Also among the escapees were lions, tigers, bears and wolves, the agency reported. Georgia's prime minister, Irakli Garibashvili, asked residents to stay home while the animals are rounded up. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also urged everyone to stay indoors but said in a statement that the situation was "under full control." All efforts are being made to find the animals quickly, "give them injections," and get them back into the zoo, the ministry said. Two employees of the zoo were among the fatalities.  The problems began before midnight Saturday. Heavy rainfall turned the Vere River, normally little more than a stream through the center of Tbilisi, into a torrent, the news agency reported. The raging river flooded significant portions of a highway, swept away cars and at least one small house, and flooded many other homes. Images on Tbilisi City Hall's Facebook page showed roads washed out, hillsides collapsed and vehicles tossed about like toys. Rescue workers carried people on their shoulders through waist-high water. Police used a helicopter to evacuate 16 people from Akhaldaba, just west of Tbilisi, where heavy rain had damaged roads.  </corpo>

            <descricao>A smuggler boat captain who trafficks children into Europe explains why he does and why he blames the kids' parents.</descricao>
            <corpo>Burj Mughayzil, Egypt (CNN)On a sandy beach in one of the many inlets dotting Egypt's Mediterranean coastline two men are standing off to one side watching us interview families whose children have been trafficked into Europe. Eventually the taller of them begins to jump in. He starts shouting and explaining why he works on the smuggler boats carrying the human cargo into Europe. "What does the government do for us? We're fishermen but there's nothing to catch." The village, Burj Mughayzil, is essentially a smugglers' village. By their own count 2,000 young men and boys have disappeared. Some as young as 11 and 12, they are lured by the European dream -- but so many of them either end up in Italian jails accused of crewing the smuggling ships or killed in the crossing. We were hoping somewhere on the beach to find a crewman on a smuggling ship, someone who had made the journey and returned. We found two; the tall man and his slimmer friend, who told us they were a ship's mate and a captain. When I asked if they'd talk on camera they agreed. To our surprise they both asked to show their faces and to give their names. CNN has retraced the route traveled by the children from small villages on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, across the sea to Sicily by boat, then making their way to the Italian capital, Rome, where they fall victim to drug and prostitution rings. Thousands of children are risking their lives, falling prey to traffickers, for the dream of a better future for them and their families. Captain Mahmoud and Mohammed told us: "We work the ships. Me and a crew of 15 people. If the [Egyptian] government was helping us in any way we wouldn't be crossing in any way." The trips can take up to nine days on the open seas. The Egyptian Government says it has increased its vigilance along the coastline but still the smugglers are finding ways out. Sometimes he says, 20 boys are crammed on a tiny fishing boat fitted with an onboard motor, so they can be brought out to sea where he and his crew wait on a bigger boat which holds up to 600 people. 'It's risky for the boat and for everyone on it. We could be sentenced to 25 years or be executed if anything happens, God forbid, to anyone on board if it becomes a death trip." He also risks years in an Italian jail on the other side and a 15,000 euro ($17,000) fine for every single person on board. The fine can stretch into the millions, Italian authorities say. It's a risk he knowingly takes. Though, the captain says, leaving him and his men "to rot in jail," is not the solution. "There are big fish and there are small fish. The small fish are the ones who are in Italian jails. The big fish live freely here in Egypt, freely in Italy." Many of the parents claim it is the children themselves who want to go -- but teens we spoke to in Italy say their families expect them to work once they get to Europe and to send money home. Others admit Europe is seen as a way of earning the family much-needed cash but they say they didn't know about the trafficker gangs behind the smuggling routes. Yet others say they were deceived by the smugglers who make empty promises of opportunity across the Med. Authorities in both countries are clear, they say the parents are guilty -- at the very least -- of abandoning their children. The smugglers, Captain Mahmoud says, are very brazen. "We leave here at dusk, dawn, whenever. It doesn't matter if you know you are risking jail anyway. We'll have been paid -- us and the crew - 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,300) each. That feeds a crewman's family and kids for a month. Then after that, who knows? Risk it again or die of hunger." Egyptian minors have been flooding into Italy by the thousands according to the Italian Ministry of Labor, taking advantage of Italian laws that grant state protection to those under 18 who arrive in Italy unaccompanied. It's not just the passengers that are underage though; his crew often is as well. Captain Mahmoud says they are pressured by their families. "People here in this village, they're selling their kids. They think, 'we're 10 [people] and we can't find enough to eat. When we're nine, we can eat a little better. If we're eight, we can eat even better still. If two get locked up? Better than we all die together.' All the people in Italian jails? They're the victims of the parents here who can't afford to eat." I asked if they felt a responsibility for the people making the crossing, for those who have died. "How can we not?" he said. "If anything happens to them, it happens to us. If the ship sinks we drown together." His tall friend, Mohammed, talks over him, "How can we not be sad? These are our cousins, our brothers. I still see their faces." At the end of the interview Captain Mahmoud asks again if we're going to broadcast this, if his government will see this. I tell him, yes, we will. Good, he says. Let them hear the truth.

            <descricao>It's a variation on the informal street basketball played all over the world -- and now 3x3 is one of the star attractions at the first-ever European Games.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into countries around the world. This time we travel to Azerbaijan in the lead up to the European Games to explore the culture of sports in the country sitting on the Caspian Sea. (CNN)It's a variation on the sort of informal street basketball played all over the world -- and now 3x3 is one of the star attractions at the first-ever European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan. But what, exactly, does the game involve? As its name suggests, it's a pared-down version of the traditional five-a-side version, needing just three players on each team. That pared-down nature extends to the playing space, half the size of the court required for a full game and using only one hoop rather than two. The popularity of 3x3 has rocketed since the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) chose it as an alternative form of the game to be played at the 2010 Youth Olympics in Singapore.  Its large-scale roots, though, go back further than that: American organization Hoop It Up organized a major competition back in 1989, while similar events were held in the U.S. during the early 1990s. After making the decision to promote 3x3 for Singapore, officials worked on the compilation of a set of rules that could be applied just as well in international competition as they could in pickup street games. The result is a sport that just won't stop growing -- FIBA estimates that around 250 million people around the world enjoy 3x3, with more and more continuing to join a sprawling network of organizers, leagues and players. Azerbaijani athlete Amil Hamzayev, whose achievements in 3x3 include winning the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries twice, is one of those players. The 24-year old tells the official Baku 2015 website that one of the biggest challenges of playing 3x3 is the effect of weather conditions -- a hazard unknown, of course, to players of the indoor game. "I'm excited to represent my country in front of our national crowd," Hamzayev -- who names American legend Michael Jordan as his favorite basketball star -- says.  A word or two about those 3x3 rules: they're nice and easy. Baskets scored from inside the arc bring a point, while those scored from outside bring two. Games are played over a single period of 10 minutes and won by the first team to score 21 points or the team with the highest score at the end of the 10 minutes. If the scores are tied at the end of the 10 minutes, overtime is played and the winner of the game is the first team to score two points. And that's the only thing about 3x3 that doesn't appeal to Hamzayev. He would rather see the victors needing three, necessitating more than one basket -- but he admits he would have been all at sea without basketball. "I would probably have finished naval college and become a ship's captain by now," he says.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Rachel Dolezal has a right to be black (Opinion)  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Should we indict Rachel Dolezal for her racial deceit?  </descricao>
            <corpo>Camille Gear Rich is professor of law and sociology at USC Gould School of Law. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)When it comes to identity, America takes one step forward and two steps back. On Monday, Rachel Dolezal, the head of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, resigned in shame because she had posed as a black woman even though she is biologically white. The outing of Dolezal seems ironic given the recent public embrace of Caitlyn Jenner, the transgender woman formerly known as Bruce Jenner. Jenner seems to have ushered in an era of greater tolerance about the constructed nature of identity. After all, when a transgender woman is elevated to the cover of Vanity Fair, it's as though we have reached a tipping point. We can accept the idea that one's social identity can be radically transformed if it doesn't match with what one feels in the heart. The stark difference in Dolezal's treatment forces us to ask what's the difference between claiming a gender identity versus a racial identity? Why is it that we celebrate Bruce Jenner's gender change and frown upon Rachel Dolezal's racial change? Dolezal is disturbing for many people because she marks a cultural fault line. Like it or not, we have entered into an era of elective race -- a time when people expect that one has a right and dignity to claim the identity of one's choice. The central issue that separates Jenner's and Dolezal's choices is deception. Jenner chose carefully how and when she would disclose herself as actually female. Dolezal's involuntary outing was staged by her angry parents who felt left behind as she chose a life associated with being a black person. The irony of the situation is certainly not lost on Dolezal's parents, who adopted several black children who became Dolezal's siblings, perhaps giving her the first taste of what it would be like to be in a black community. As much as critics try to characterize Dolezal's behavior as a fraudulent choice, sociologists and psychologists know that decisions about racial and ethnic identity are typically not merely expressive, strategic, or apolitical, but are driven by social conditions. Growing up in a family with black siblings exposed Dolezal to the reality of discrimination and made her more sensitive to its effects. It probably helped her understand the contrast between the reality of black lives and white privilege. Other similar experiences, such as marrying an African-American and having black children, also make white people more sensitive to racism. Dolezal likely became politically and socially conscious about these issues because of her experiences in an interracial family. In this sense, her parents must be proud of the child they raised. Should we indict Dolezal for her racial deceit? That depends on a number of factors. What accounts for her decision to "become" black instead of remaining white to advocate for racial justice? Did Dolezal feel that her white skin made her suspect as she engaged in political activism? Did she fear it would be a distraction as she attempted to gain credibility in racial justice efforts? Opinion: Passing for black? Now that's a twist Of course, she could have attained a leadership role in the NAACP as a white woman, but did the perception that she was black make people feel more objective about her performance rather than skeptical about her understanding and commitment to anti-racism? Was she aesthetically driven? Dolezal claims that she has been in love with black aesthetics since childhood. The decision to adopt a black female aesthetic for herself is a political act given that Americans in general assume black women are not aesthetically as desirable as white women. Yet, others reduce her aesthetic choices to mere cultural appropriation. People allow Caitlyn Jenner to change because she has some biological basis for believing she is female. But is this all identity is? Are we prepared to accept the implications of this view? What if Dolezal can identify one "biologically" black ancestor -- does this suddenly make her claim to blackness valid? If she cannot, does this failure render invalid her connections to blackness, and all of her efforts to make the world better for African Americans? In my view, hate the sin but love the sinner. Dolezal lied. She should not have lied, but she lied for reasons with which we can sympathize. I admire the way she chose to live her life as a black person. Advocating for anti-racism efforts is ethical and admirable if she wanted to claim blackness as a social identity. Those quick to throw stones well know that there are costs to living life as a black person, and once Dolezal made the switch she seems never to have looked back. I will not indict her for her choice to link herself to this community, and I would consider her claim no greater if she identified a long lost African ancestor. Dolezal's case forces us to examine our society, which made her feel that passing for a black woman was her best choice in her advocacy for African American issues. She forces us to consider whether our biology or our action is more important to identity, and should we act in ways that honor our chosen identity in meaningful ways. We should not have to be slaves to the biological definition of identity, and we should not use race or gender identities as weapons to punish one another. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            <cabecalho>Man attacked by Tiger shark while snorkeling  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A 58-year-old man from Overland Park, Kansas, was bitten by a shark while snorkeling with relatives in the waters off Hapuna Beach State Park in Hawaii. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)What started out as a family day of snorkeling, turned into an unforgettable and dangerous moment for a man recovering from a shark attack in Hawaii. "This black cloud appeared and I wasn't sure what it was ... and the shape moved toward me quickly and it materialized into a 10- to 12-foot tiger shark," Dr. Ken Grasing told reporters Friday at The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. Flanked by his wife and two sons, the 58-year-old physician from Overland Park, Kansas, sat in a wheelchair. Grasing said he had just wrapped up a day of snorkeling in the waters off Hapuna Beach State Park on the Big Island of Hawaii when Wednesday's attack occurred. It took place in about 5 feet of water, when he was surrounded by people. "It all happened very rapidly; the shark bit my left hand," Grasing said. "And then as it moved past me, I struck it with my good hand on the side of the head. "The shark then swam around me, stayed in the area, and I stood there just yelling. It was quite a dramatic moment. My two boys were with me in the water and I was very concerned that the shark would attack them." Grasing was hospitalized for severe cuts to his left forearm and an injury to his left leg, probably from a shark fin scrape. He's expected to make a full recovery. But he wonders what could have happened. "This is a magnificent animal swimming with great speed and power. I was really at its mercy, and if it had mind to do anything more, that would have been the end of me," he said. Hawaii is home to approximately 40 species of sharks. The tiger shark, which can reach up to 16 feet in length, has been called "the garbage can of the sea" because of its wide variety of prey, according to the state's shark website. A NOAA fact sheet says the tiger is one of the top sharks involved in unprovoked fatal attacks throughout the world and is the leading attack species in Hawaii. The state park was closed Wednesday and shark warnings were posted along parts of the coast outside the park. The same shark was reportedly spotted swimming in the area about an hour after the attack. Grasing, who doesn't know if he'll ever go snorkeling again, says his reaction to hit the shark in the head was very difficult "because there's a lot of teeth there that are sharp and its moving fast." But he says what may have saved him is that "fortunately it didn't like what it tasted." CNN's Tina Burnside and Greg Morrison contributed to this report </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Most diverse place in America is not where you think - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A neighborhood in Anchorage lies in the most diverse census tract in America and life there is far from the stereotype of Alaska.</descricao>
            <corpo>Anchorage, Alaska (CNN)The shelves at the Red Apple Market are a giveaway. Dried squid. Sambal Olek chili paste. Corned Australian mutton. Canned grass jelly. Another clue: Ride the crowded No. 45 bus, which meanders down Mountain View Drive, and you hear chatter in seven languages -- none, English. That these markers of diversity are in a neighborhood in Anchorage may surprise folks from the Lower 48 who picture Alaska as a largely homogenous and snowy American extremity. But Alaskans are quite proud of their distinctive demographics. Remember Sarah Palin's much-parodied 2008 interview with Katie Couric? One segment ended with this line: "Believe me, Alaska is like a microcosm of America." Palin was taken to task for her claim because Alaska's black and Latino populations are lower than the national average. And yet ... Mountain View, a northeast Anchorage neighborhood, boasts the most diverse census tract in all of America. That's according to University of Alaska sociology professor Chad Farrell, who analyzed the census data. In fact, Farrell says the country's three most diverse census tracts are all in Anchorage, followed by a handful in Queens, as in New York, which usually tops everyone's diversity guess list. Mao Tosi, an American Samoan and former NFL defensive end, returned to Mountain View after his career with the Arizona Cardinals ended. He wanted to be a part of this rapid change and help the Samoan community assimilate. "This place is a snapshot into America's future," says Tosi, his 6-foot-6 frame casting an imposing shadow in the Northway Mall that he operates. He speaks of a future in which America will no longer be majority white. Most predictions say that will happen by the middle of this century, and Tosi thinks the nation can take a cue or two from Mountain View. "Kids are growing up here without knowing the color of their skin," he says. "They are more influenced by what their neighbor is doing."  So how exactly did Mountain View score so high in diversity? Farrell explains the index he used to measure diversity: He looked at the number of ethnic and racial groups, but more importantly, he studied their size relative to one another. Farrell found that two things boosted Mountain View to the top. First, there is a sizable white population left. In many other places, neighborhoods that have increased in diversity have also seen white flight. Not so in Mountain View. Mountain View also has a significant Alaska Native population, which other cities in America lack. Alaska's diversity has spiked in recent years for a host of reasons. Among them are its economy, which prospered when other states were reeling from recession, because it is driven by fishing and oil. The state is also home to nine military bases, and Mountain View butts up to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Hawaiian businessman William Hoopai recently opened a new restaurant on the main drag called West Berlin. Yup. Schnitzels and sauerkraut attract a lot of uniformed men and women who have spent time in Germany. And there has been new immigration to Alaska -- including refugees from troubled nations such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Cuba, Iran and Bhutan. Many have resettled here in Mountain View. Omima Adam, a civil engineer from Sudan, arrived in 2010. "I was so shocked when I saw all that snow," she says from the window of her food truck, Sultan Shawarma, parked between a Dominican place and an espresso stand. "But I'd rather be cold than dead," she says of the bloodshed in her native Darfur. She learned English and puts her heart and soul into her kibbes, shawarmas and falafel. She wants to turn the business into a full-fledged restaurant and return to college to earn an engineering degree that the United States will recognize. Mountain View was her new beginning.  It's obvious this is not a wealthy place. Between the colorful new houses built by Cook Inlet Housing Authority lie scarred and tattered structures with molting paint and boarded windows. Mountain View Boulevard is lined with stores such as Price Busters and Cash America Pawn. The big anchor stores all abandoned Northway Mall, Alaska's first enclosed one. The last census counted 39% of households as earning less than $25,000; 19% fall below the poverty line. That explains why Alice "Mother" Lawrence's house is full every afternoon. The 79-year-old runs a nonprofit that collects foods that have exhausted their shelf lives in local groceries and distributes them to the hungry. Bread, pastries, fruits, vegetables, snacks, soft drinks. She landed here in 1967 as a military wife. She had a lot of kids and after her first husband left her, she learned how to get tough. "No one helped me here," she says. "They wouldn't give me a penny." That's when she found the Lord and her calling in life: to help the needy. She acquired a Casio keyboard and lined up seven church pews in her living room to minister to the poor. Her son, Randy Lawrence, says people he knows in other states say: "What? There are black people in Alaska?" Mountain View's census tract is 13.1% African-American, which is about the national average. Lawrence, 49, describes Anchorage as a wannabe bad-ass city. "It's not," he laughs as he unloads boxes of day-old cinnamon buns. "As for Mountain View? It's the 'hood. This is as bad as it gets around here." Yeah, there's gangs and drugs and other kinds of crime that's inextricably linked to poverty. But he likes living in a smaller place that is so racially mixed. "As a black man, I have to say you got a better shot at life here," he said, comparing it with New Jersey, where he was born. Carnard Davis, 44, agrees. He moved here from the now-demolished Bowen Homes housing project in southwest Atlanta and works at the Boys and Girls Club, where he's simply known as Mr. C. "I came here on vacation and saw how smooth and easy it was here," he says. "And I wanted a change." The club is full on this cold afternoon with kids from at least a dozen places. They don't all speak English well, but Davis says it doesn't matter. On the wall is a poster board with the question: "What does this place mean to you?" Many of the answers say, "family." One says: "This is a place I can be me."  Mountain View wasn't always a global petri dish. It grew up as a first-ring suburb that was annexed by Anchorage in the 1950s. It boomed as the place that accommodated transient oil workers who came for jobs on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The history is reflected in Mountain View's housing, a low-cost stock that consists of numerous duplexes and apartment complexes, which in turn attracted people looking for low-rent places in a state where high construction costs make decent housing expensive. After the pipeline was finished, Mountain View fell into decline. Crime soared in the 1980s and 1990s and the neighborhood got a bad rap. Architectural designer Clark Yerrington moved here in 1999 and recalls how his friends were shocked. It was common to hear people in Anchorage at that time say: "Never move into a neighborhood that ends with 'view.' " Mountain View and Fairview, named for their proximity to the Chugach Mountains, had become unsafe. In the height of the crack cocaine era, the blocks around Yerrington's house were "switched on all night." "It was sketchy," says Yerrington, who is white. "I moved here because it was affordable. I did not expect to be here long." His friends refused to visit him. But he's glad he stayed. Mountain View has been bouncing back in recent years, says Kirk Rose, executive director of the Anchorage Community Land Trust, which has purchased and rehabilitated properties and encourages revitalization. A credit union converted an eyesore gas station and opened the first financial institution around these parts. Before that, there were only pawn shops that charged 20% for cashing a check, Rose says. "The credit union has added 3,000 new accounts," he says. And growth around Mountain View has helped. Olive Garden opened last year (a big deal), and now clothing giant H&amp;M has announced it's coming to Anchorage (an even bigger deal). That's the buzz on the street. Key to Mountain View is its strong housing authority, which has shepherded construction of affordable homes. One reason the homes are cheaper is because buyers only pay for the house. The housing authority owns the land. The better housing has helped change the neighborhood from being largely transient to one where people want to stay, Rose says. "And that is so important for the health of a community." Yerrington proudly displays a collection of photos on his dining room wall. They are of houses in Mountain View, each a representation of a place he finds unique. There's no white part of town. No Aleut village. Or Chinatown. There are no set patterns. "We all live together. Even white people like me. Think how it would be if the whole country had been organized like this. It does people good to break out of their comfort zone and mix with neighbors who are different." And there's one more thing. It's Alaska. Yerrington's home is surrounded by wilderness and wildlife. Mountains and moose. He can't think of another place in America quite like this.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>New York prison break: Was husband warned about plan? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Prison tailor Joyce Mitchell warned her husband about inmates' plans to break out and told him his life could be in danger, a source tells CNN.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Lyle Mitchell did not know about a sexual relationship between his wife, Joyce Mitchell, and fugitive Richard Matt or David Sweat, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Lyle Mitchell learned of the alleged murder plot from his wife, the source added. Joyce Mitchell was aware of the plot to kill her husband and warned him that his life could be in danger, another source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. "I don't believe she was involved in any attempt to kill her husband," her attorney, Stephen Johnston, told CNN. "Just because she heard something doesn't mean she was going to act on it. ... She did not want to be a part of it and did not." Johnston said he has received only one of his client's statements to police, and he expected the bulk of her statements, which could amount to as much as 20 hours of transcripts and audio, to be delivered to him sometime Thursday. He has spoken to Joyce Mitchell twice -- once briefly before a Monday court appearance and a more in-depth conversation Monday evening, he said. Lyle Mitchell's wife is accused of helping the two convicted murderers break out of a New York prison. No court date has been set for Joyce Mitchell, who has pleaded not guilty to the two charges brought against her and has been talking to authorities. If convicted, she could face up to eight years behind bars.  The escape plan, a source says, included a plot to kill Lyle Mitchell. But officials say they're still trying to determine exactly what he knew as part of their escape investigation. A source with direct knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Joyce Mitchell, a prison tailor shop instructor, knew the two inmates had plotted to kill her husband, told him about their plans to break out of the facility and warned him that his life could be in danger. But a lawyer representing Lyle Mitchell said the husband, who also worked in the prison's tailoring block, was kept in the dark. "He didn't know anything about the escape plan," attorney Peter Dumas said. As of now, investigators have no information that Lyle Mitchell had prior knowledge of the escape or actively assisted in it, Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said. Also, investigators don't think that Lyle Mitchell was involved in plotting the escape, the source with direct knowledge of the investigation said. Authorities are trying to determine the exact nature of Joyce Mitchell's relationship with Matt and Sweat, but they already know it was years in the making. She'd been investigated in the past for an inappropriate relationship with Sweat that led corrections officials to move him out of the tailor shop in 2013 and keep them separated, Wylie has said. That's the year when she started having a sexual relationship with Matt, the source said. The sexual relationship took place at the tailor shop in the Clinton Correctional Facility, the only known place the two were together, the source said.  Authorities looking for Matt and Sweat have searched 16 square miles -- more than 10,000 acres, which is the equivalent of almost 8,000 football fields -- New York State Police Maj. Charles Guess told reporters Wednesday. Police have also developed more than 1,400 leads, the major said. Guess reiterated what state police said Tuesday: that authorities are expanding the search to other areas surrounding Dannemora, New York. There are now 600 local, state and federal law enforcement officers involved in the search, a drop from the 800 involved Tuesday. Guess said that since authorities are "no longer containing a hard perimeter," they released about 200 officers, but there has been no reduction in the number of tactical, canine, aviation or ground search units. "There's no hard evidence that they're outside the area. That being said, I can't rule that out," said Capt. Robert LaFountain, of the New York State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Asked if authorities miscalculated by spending so much time searching near the Clinton Correctional Facility, the state police captain added, "Absolutely not. We (had) to start from ... point zero." The captain remains confident that Matt and Sweat will be found, he said. "We are going to locate the individuals and they will be apprehended," he said.  On Tuesday, Lyle Mitchell was face to face with his wife for the first time since her arrest last week. She's accused of sneaking hacksaw blades, chisels, drill bits, a punch and other contraband into the convicts' hands before they broke out. The couple spent an hour together and were separated by glass, speaking over a phone in a private, unmonitored conversation, Clinton County Sheriff David Favro said. Lyle Mitchell was supportive, and his wife seemed comforted by his visit -- the first she'd had since her arrest, the sheriff said. "He's providing support," said Dumas, Lyle Mitchell's attorney. "He's not planning to testify on her behalf." Johnston, Joyce Mitchell's attorney, said he did not know what the two talked about. He described his client's state of mind as "distraught, very weepy and very upset." She has been moved about 175 miles south to the Rensselaer County Jail, east of Albany, police said. "She's rather composed, given the gravity of what's going on," Favro said. Dumas said Lyle Mitchell is also struggling to deal with what's happened and the revelation that "possibly there was a plan to do some harm to him." "He's very confused. It's just a lot that's been thrown on his plate right now," Dumas said. "He's kind of reeling." Wylie has not commented much on the husband, other than to say he's under investigation. Investigators are looking at other prison employees as well and haven't ruled out that they may have played a role in the escape, the source with knowledge of the investigation said. Officials are also investigating whether other inmates might have helped create some type of diversion before, during or after Matt and Sweat escaped, the source said. Authorities are investigating whether the two inmates threatened Mitchell to force her to help, a New York state official briefed on the investigation told CNN. Investigators say they think Mitchell began getting cold feet about executing the plan but possibly had agreed to supply a getaway car because of threats to her and her husband, the official said.  With few clues pointing toward where Matt and Sweat went after they escaped, investigators are changing tack. The search stretched into day 12 on Wednesday. The area that hundreds of law enforcement officers are combing is expanding, New York State Police said Tuesday evening. Teams will be redeployed to new areas near the prison in Dannemora, New York, police said, saying the shifting search zone was based on information uncovered in the hunt for the fugitives. Canine units are still searching for a scent that might lead police to Matt and Sweat, who escaped from the maximum-security facility known as "Little Siberia" in upstate New York on June 6. "We're putting our heart and soul into this," Favro, the Clinton County sheriff, said of the search. "I'm confident that we'll be able to get these two." But after earlier promising leads went cold, officials aren't even sure they're looking in the right place. The fugitives could have made it across Lake Champlain to Vermont, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said he talked to his counterpart there to thrash out a "cooperative agreement" for the search. Another possibility is Canada, whose border lies just 20 miles north of the prison. But Jonathan Gilliam, a former FBI agent who has led manhunts, says the killers wouldn't try to drive past border checkpoints -- and going on foot through the thick woods is even harder. "It's kind of a harsh environment, cold at night," he told CNN. "They're instantly setting themselves up for a fall."  Searchers are scouring parts of the Adirondacks in upstate New York, a 6 million-acre wilderness at the doorstep of the prison. It's filled with hundreds of cabins, many of them abandoned in the off-season. Investigators think Matt and Sweat could be holed up in one of them. Or, they warn, the pair could invade a home and take hostages. But Gilliam says that would be "a big chance to take." "If you do that, even if you leave, now you've set a footprint for the police to latch onto," he said. According to authorities, Joyce Mitchell says Matt and Sweat told her they planned to drive to an unspecified destination about seven hours away. She backed out of the getaway plan, and it's unclear what other options the killers had in mind. But driving for that length of time at an average speed of 60 mph would put big cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia within reach. Those environments might be easier ones in which to disappear. "People are very aware of who's around them" in small towns, said Gilliam. "They're very aware of what other people are doing. Once you get into a larger city, people just stop paying attention."  Even farther afield is Mexico, a possibility that Cuomo mentioned over the weekend. The country, about 2,000 miles away, features in Matt's past. In 1997, he murdered a man near Buffalo, New York, and then fled to Mexico, where he killed another man before being captured. He had "Mexico Forever" tattooed on his back, police say. Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the escaped inmates' arrests. It's not clear how much money has been spent, but judging from the boots on the ground, it can't be cheap. And time may be increasingly on the killers' side. "You can't sustain this type of a manhunt for very long," Gilliam said. "It's just too much of a vacuum of all other resources."

            <corpo>(CNN)A dip in the ocean at Cocoa Beach, Florida, turned menacing Sunday for a 10-year-old boy who was bitten by a shark as he waded in waist-high water with his mother. Lifeguards came to the rescue when they saw the boy struggling in the water Sunday morning, carried him to the shore and provided emergency care after realizing a shark bit him, Brevard County, Florida, Ocean Rescue Assistant Chief Eisen Witcher told CNN. The boy suffered a severe bite on his calf and was flown to a trauma hospital in Orlando due to the severity of the injury, Witcher said. "It was definitely one of the worst ones that we've seen in our area that we've responded to, mainly because of the size of the bite," Witcher said. He said the animal that injured the boy may have been a juvenile bull shark. The beach was closed for about an hour, Brevard County spokesman Don Walker told CNN. Brevard officials have responded to about 10 shark bites this year, Witcher said.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Like a scene from a B-movie, hordes of bright red crabs have taken over San Diego's coastline from Ocean Beach to La Jolla. Masses of the small red tuna crabs, or pelagic red crabs, have been washing up along the southern California shoreline for the past couple of weeks, according to local media reports. The striking sight may be the result of warm water carrying the crustaceans from their usual home along the west coast of Baja California and the Gulf of California, according to Linsey Sala, a museum scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. "Typically such strandings of these species in large numbers are due to warm water intrusions," said Sala. The species, proper name Pleuroncodes planipes, is unique in that it can live its entire life cycle, from larva to adulthood, in the water column from surface to seafloor, she said. This makes it vulnerable to being carried along by winds, tides, and currents. The scarlet-shelled visitors have certainly caught the eye of local residents. "The sand was sprinkled with red for as far as you could see," said freelance photographer and San Diego resident Jim Grant, who shared his images with CNN iReport. Grant spotted some folks picking up live crabs and taking them home to cook. While the crabs are pretty to look at, experts warn against eating them because they could contain unknown toxins.

            <cabecalho>Who is Rachel Dolezal? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Much has been made in recent days over what Rachel Dolezal is or is not. She says she identifies as black, but her parents say she's white.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Much has been made in recent days over what Rachel Dolezal is or is not. Dolezal, who stepped down as head of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, says she identifies as black. Her parents say she is white, like them. But regardless of her race, Dolezal has been many other things as well: a civil rights leader, a teacher, an artist, a hair stylist and a mother. "Overall, my life has been one of survival, and the decisions that I have made along the way, including my identification, have been to survive," she told NBC's "Today" show on Tuesday. Here's a look at what we know about her life so far:  The Lincoln County, Montana, birth certificate provided by her parents says Rachel Anne Dolezal was born on November 12, 1977. Her parents are listed as Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal, both of whom are white. That means Rachel Dolezal is white, correct? Not if you ask her. While it's not been corroborated, she claimed on NBC that "there were no medical witnesses to my birth" and pointed out the discrepancy between the time of her birth and when her birth certificate was filed, seven weeks later. "I haven't had a DNA test," she added. "There's been no biological proof that Larry and Ruthanne are my biological parents." She's also reportedly claimed to have been born in a teepee, an assertion her adopted brother Ezra Dolezal -- who said his parents lived in a teepee for a month, but not when Rachel was born -- dismissed as a lie. And her parents also find the idea that somehow she's not their biological child, and thus not white, to be deceptive and ridiculous. "We are her birth parents," Larry Dolezal told CNN last week. "We do not understand why she feels it's necessary to misrepresent her ethnicity."  Rachel Dolezal doesn't deny that Ruthanne and Larry raised her in Montana, where the couple still lives. And her parents have said she was raised in an evangelical Christian household. What's in dispute is her feelings and actions growing up, especially as they relate to her racial identity. She told NBC's Matt Lauer that, when she was 5, she drew her self-portraits in brown rather than peach crayon and made herself have curly, black hair rather than the straight, blonde locks she sported at the time. In other words, Rachel Dolezal claims to have seen herself as black rather than white from an early age -- so identifying now as black means she's being true to herself, not trying to pretend to be something that she's not. Still, she said her path has been made harder from having been "socially conditioned (to) be limited to whatever biological identity was thrust upon me." "I felt very isolated with my identity virtually my entire life, that nobody really got it and that I really didn't have the personal agency to express it," she said. "I kind of imagined that maybe at some point (I'd have to) own it publicly and discuss this kind of complexity. (But) I wasn't expecting it to be thrust upon me right now." Her parents don't buy it. While the family had friends of various ethnicities and encouraged diversity, they say that doesn't mean Rachel Dolezal was constrained or saw herself as anything but white. "She did not ever refer to herself or draw pictures (like the described self-portraits) or do anything that indicated she thought she was black," said Ruthanne Dolezal.  According to Dolezal's LinkedIn page, she graduated magna cum laude from Belhaven University in Jackson, Mississippi. While there, she says she petitioned for the first annual celebration of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Day and developed the first African-American history course on campus. Dolezal also says she tutored kids and taught drawing. From Mississippi, she moved to Washington D.C. to attend Howard University. Rachel didn't identify herself as black on her Howard application, because there was no such option. But people there may have assumed as much "because her portfolio of art was all African-American portraiture," her mother Ruthanne said. She ended up graduating with a Master of Fine Arts degree. But her time at the historically black college wasn't all smooth. In fact, she sued Howard for discrimination (against her, as a white woman) in 2002, which would have been about the time her biological son Franklin was born. Specifically, she alleged that the decision to remove some of her artwork from a student exhibition was motivated by a discriminatory desire to favor black students over her. That lawsuit was dismissed. And on Monday, Howard spokeswoman Rachel Mann said the school considers the case closed and declined further comment.  Dolezal has held a variety of positions since graduating. Her LinkedIn page says she was the director of education for the Human Rights Education Institute in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. She was also an adjunct professor at North Idaho College there. Dolezal describes herself as an artist, model, ethnic hair stylist and piano teacher. She shows off some of her work on her blog. In 2007, Dolezal writes that she began teaching at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Washington. She no longer works there; her part-time stint ended on June 12, as scheduled, school spokesman David Meany said. That's around the same time the story broke. Just last week, the school's website featured a profile of her as a faculty member. But that's since been taken down. She also is no longer the president of Spokane's NAACP chapter, a post to which she was elected last year. She resigned from that position Monday. When the controversy surfaced, other figures in the civil rights organization stood by Dolezal. Gerald Hankerson -- the NAACP president for a region including Alaska, Washington and Oregon -- pointed out that leadership is based on a person's actions, not their genealogy. "We represent all civil rights issues, regardless of a person's ethnicity. And the quality of the work that she has done to elevate the issues of civil rights in that region is what we applaud," Hankerson told CNN. Yet the NAACP appeared to change its tune as the controversy dragged on. Talking on CNN, NAACP President Cornell Brooks called the ordeal "a distraction" that has left many "very disappointed." "What matters most to us is our credibility, our integrity," Brooks said. "So to have anything that detracts from that, or that impugns our integrity is painful and, for many of us, offensive as well." It's not clear what's next for Dolezal, but in her resignation letter, she insisted she's still an activist. "I will never stop fighting for human rights and will do everything in my power to help and assist, whether it means stepping up or stepping down, because this is not about me. It's about justice," she wrote. "This is not me quitting; this is a continuum."  There's no indication that Rachel Dolezal herself has ever had significant trouble with the law. But she has made numerous allegations that she's been a victim -- though none have led, at least so far, to any arrests or convictions. The dismissed Howard lawsuit appears to be her first foray into the legal system, but hardly her last. Dolezal claimed several times to have been harassed because of her race and activism in Spokane. In September 2009, she told Spokane police she found a noose on her front porch a few days after her house was burglarized, according to a police report. Dolezal said she had numerous problems with the Aryan Nation and other hate groups because of her job and "biracial heritage," the report said, alleging that she was "approached by three skinheads" in one month at her job at the Human Rights Institute in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. "I spent a lot of time in Mississippi so when I saw that rope, I knew what it was," she said in an article in the Coeur d'Alene Press. In February, she reported finding an unnerving letter in the post office box for the NAACP. The police report said the envelope contained copies of news articles, prints of old photos of lynching victims and quotes about socialism and the New World Order. The letter contained no direct threats against Dolezal or the NAACP, police said. Spokane police also investigated an April incident in which a man and woman came into Dolezal's house when only her son was home. The son did not indicate they were threatening, describing them as "normal, middle-class, white people" who "looked confused," according to a police report. "Dolezal did express concern that this was the third incident, the other two were unrelated ..., that had occurred while she was not at the residence," added the report. Police haven't made arrests in any of these cases.  Pictures of Rachel Dolezal growing up show a fair-skinned blonde. Today, you see a woman with a darker complexion and curly brown hair. The change was gradual but is now undeniable -- and, according to her adopted brother Ezra, tantamount to living in "blackface." "It's kind of a slap in the face to African-Americans because she doesn't know what it's like to be black," said Ezra, whose biological mother is white and whose father is partly black. "She's only been African-American when it benefited her. She hasn't been through all the struggles. She's only been African-American the last few years." Yet Rachel Dolezal contends that she has "a huge issue with blackface," which is the darkening of one's skin to appear black that is widely viewed as offensive, and "actually had to go there with the experience, not just a visual representation." "I certainly don't stay out of the sun," she told NBC. "I also don't ... put on blackface as a performance." Dolezal later addressed questions about the color of her skin, saying its hue "depends on the season" and that the most she'd do is use bronzer occasionally. She denied having any surgeries, taking any melanin shots or doing any other "experiments with transforming into a darker skin person." "Even the word 'disguise' has been put out there, but it just sounds very intentional and deceitful," Dolezal said. "I just want to feel beautiful, and this is how I feel beautiful."  Dolezal has a dad, but it isn't Larry Dolezal. She uses that term to describe another man -- a black man-- she grew close to as an adult in northern Idaho. "Any man can be a father," she told NBC. "Not every man can be a dad." Larry and Ruthanne Dolezal have at least one other biological son, according to reports. They also adopted four children, three of whom are African-American while the other is from Haiti, according to Larry Dolezal. Ezra -- who came into the family at 3 months old, at which point Rachel was 15 years old -- remembers his adopted sister as being good at art and encouraging. "Now, it is a little different because I haven't really talked to her for a while," he acknowledged. Rachel and the rest of her family appeared to start drifting apart in the mid-to-late 2000s, after she'd left home and as she came to increasingly associate herself with black culture. And the distance increased in 2010, when her adopted brother sought emancipation from Ruthanne and Larry Dolezal in 2010, according to court documents. That adopted brother -- Izaiah, now 21 -- wanted to live with Rachel Dolezal "in a multiracial household where black culture is celebrated and I have a connection to the black community," the documents said. The petition for emancipation was dropped. In a separate legal action in 2010, the court appointed Rachel Dolezal to be the adopted brother's guardian with the consent of Ruthanne and Larry Dolezal. Rachel Dolezal contends she has the full support of Izaiah and her 13-year-old biological son Franklin, saying one of them recently told her, "'Mom, racially you're human and culturally you're black.'" Franklin expressed his sentiments in an interview with NBC. "I always felt like she deserved more, she deserved to be known (worldwide) but not like this -- not as a liar, deceiver," the boy said. "She should be known as a hero."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Instead of asking, "How could they do this horrible thing?" the more pertinent question might be, "When did he start doing horrible things?"</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)After every horrific crime that shocks us, the next question we often ask is, "How could anyone do such a thing?" If the criminal is a psychopath, the answer is very simple. They don't feel empathy or guilt. So instead of asking, "How could they do this horrible thing?" the more pertinent question might be, "When did they start doing horrible things?"  Psychopaths are pathological liars, manipulators, and charmers. They have a distinct lack of remorse for their own bad actions, a failure to accept responsibility for the same, and an overall lack of empathy. They are impulsive and irresponsible, seeking constant stimulation. Many are horribly violent and their motives "more commonly will involve sadistic gratification," according to an FBI bulletin devoted to the disorder. "The psychopath is an intraspecies predator," it reads. Psychopaths are found in every country, belong to every race, and the majority are men. According to several studies, roughly 1% of the men in the United States are probably psychopaths, and they most likely exhibited signs at a very young age. Those signs are key -- there is no known cure for full-blown psychopathy.  Researchers continue to search for a successful treatment plan, but "we don't have a therapy for it, and there's no known pill for psychopathy," said Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former FBI profiler who has written extensively about psychopaths. Any attempt at therapy has to be carefully structured and monitored, particularly in the case of a criminal psychopath, as they are equipped with the skill and motivation to act more as a predator than a patient. They can easily identify weaknesses in their therapists and feign progress to shorten treatment. Psychopaths don't seek out treatment on their own, said Robert Hare, who has studied psychopathy for more than 40 years and developed the scale used to measure it. He explained that psychopaths, not suffering any psychological or physical pain, don't believe there's anything about themselves that needs fixing. What kind of treatment might a psychopath even receive? "You can try to train them to feel emotions," said Hare, "but that is like trying to train a cat to be a mouse. None of the programs seem to work except those that change behavioral problems. You might get them to look out for themselves in a different way, to develop an enlightened self-interest." And in order to do that, early detection is paramount.  "If you look back in the childhood of any offender you can find a long, long history," said Hare, who authored "Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us." For the violent psychopath, an early sign might be cruelty to animals or complete lack of caring for other children, including teasing or even hurting them. It goes beyond the typical arguments at school or scuffles between siblings. "The behavior has to be well outside the norm," Hare said. While children are not labeled psychopaths, the markers that predict a high probability a child will develop a psychopathic personality include many of the same characteristics: lack of guilt; lack of empathy; lack of concern about performance; and shallow or insincere emotions. Over time, the behavior proves to be much more severe than typical childhood selfishness. Even compared with children with other behavior disorders or psychological issues, a child who has these traits and might be clinically labeled "callous-unemotional" will stand out to parents, teachers and peers. Identifying a psychopath, or a child at risk for developing psychopathy, relies on examining his or her behavior and interacting with the child over lengthy interviews based on the checklists and scales developed by Hare. There is no quick medical test that can give a definitive verdict on whether someone is a psychopath, or to what degree. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging scans have shown some functional differences in psychopaths' brains, particularly in the frontal cortex and limbic system. Psychopathy is also an inherited condition, according to J. Reid Meloy, forensic psychologist and author of "The Psychopathic Mind." "The more severe the psychopathy, the greater the inheritance for the disorder," he said. Hare agreed, adding, "There are genetic factors involved. There is enormous evidence indicating psychopathy is an interaction between genetics and the environment."  In the search for a treatment or management plan for psychopathy, "early intervention is really the only thing that's been shown to be effective," said Matt Logan, another leading researcher in the field and a former prison psychologist. Intensive, regular, long-term intervention from both parents and teachers is key. Programs may use cognitive behavioral therapy, group therapy, or other methods. Because children showing high levels of the callous-unemotional traits also typically have very low levels of fear and anxiety, they usually don't have a positive behavior change from programs emphasizing discipline. They are more likely to respond well to positive reinforcement and reward-oriented programs. Though there is some debate, many researchers believe it's important to recognize the children who need this specific, tailored help, even at the risk of a stigmatizing label like callous-unemotional, or later, psychopath. The goal, Hare said, "is to get these children to act more in line with what society expects." And as Hare points out, "Not all psychopaths are criminals. They are in business, government, academia and media. You'll find lots of these people, but they're not committing criminal acts. They will take advantage of people." Perhaps if potential psychopaths are given, at a very young age, the tools to get what they want within the laws and expectations of society, a greater number could live extraordinarily productive lives. Does being a psychopath make you more successful?  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>America's homeless doctor brings health care to streets - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Dr. Jim Withers has created a global "street medicine" movement to bring medical care to the homeless.</descricao>
            <corpo>Pittsburgh (CNN)Dr. Jim Withers used to dress like a homeless person. On purpose. Two to three nights a week, he rubbed dirt in his hair and muddied up his jeans and shirt before walking the dark streets of Pittsburgh, searching for the very people he was trying to emulate. Withers wanted to connect with those who had been excluded from his care. "I was actually really shocked how ill people were on the street. It was like going to a third-world country," he said. "Young, old, people with mental illness, runaway kids, women (who) fled domestic violence, veterans. And they all have their own story." Homelessness costs the medical system a lot of money. Individuals often end up in emergency rooms, and stay there longer, because their illnesses go untreated and can lead to complications. For 23 years, Withers has been treating the homeless -- under bridges, in alleys and along riverbanks. "We realized that this was something that could be addressed. We could make 'house calls,' " he said. It's something that Withers' father, a rural doctor, often did. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 Withers' one-man mission became a citywide program called Operation Safety Net. Since 1992, the group has reached more than 10,000 individuals and helped more than 1,200 of them transition into housing. In addition to street rounds, the program has a mobile van, drop-in centers and a primary health clinic, all where the homeless can access medical care. Today, Withers is also fostering a global "street medicine" movement. His nonprofit, the Street Medicine Institute, supports communities in starting programs of their own. Its network includes dozens of teams in the United States and around the world. I recently talked with Withers about his work and his ultimate vision. Below is an edited version of our conversation: CNN: How does it work, doing rounds in homeless camps? Dr. Jim Withers: It can be a challenge to keep up with where the camps are. The homeless are often evicted. Their belongings are taken. And so they have to keep moving. And therefore we have to keep moving to keep up to date on their camps. Doing walking rounds, we try to keep our team down to four people. We don't want to invade (their space) with a lot of people. It's their home. So there's an outreach expert who knows the field and knows the people. There's myself or a medical person, and then we always have a student or two. And we bring a social worker with us. We'll go into the camp, and we make sure they're OK with us coming in. Almost all the homeless are cordial, if not downright really friendly. And we just join them, and they can express what's going on. We always try then to check in with how they're doing medically. If they have insurance, if they have medicines that they should be on that they ran out of. Do they have a doctor? "Did you get that looked at?" What's important to the patient, the person, is our priority. The care that we deliver out there is dependent on what's in our backpacks. We try to emphasize that this is not good enough. Getting (them) into primary care is our goal. READ: Dr. Withers in his own words CNN: What ailments do you see out there? Withers: People on the street, they're exposed to the elements obviously. So you see a lot of things that have to do with the weather and the difficulties of sleeping out there: frostbite, dehydration, hypothermia. But they also have everyday things, like high blood pressure, diabetes, coughs and colds, pneumonia, injuries. We've seen people with cancers. We've seen liver failure, people who needed dialysis that we actually took to dialysis from the street. It goes on and on and on. We've seen almost everything that I've seen clinically and a few things that I hadn't. So it's a very rich environment for medical teaching, unfortunately. CNN: You consider the streets to be a kind of classroom for students. What is their experience? Withers: I see it in the eyes of the students that I take out. They see how many people are living in places that you'd never want to live. The weather, the rain, the cold. I think they also get the chance to see success. When they can see a street person succeed and not just get locked in that hopeless category, their vision changes. The street classroom really ignites, or reignites, what their passion is. They feel like, "Yes, this is what it's about." And they carry that forward. I think the lessons the homeless can teach us about finding the humanity and listening to people are transcendent in all of health care. Our students, I like to think of them as viruses. And we're spreading them out and they're beginning to go to their medical residencies, and they're saying, "Do you have street medicine here?" or "Why aren't you going under bridges?" And so the dialogue is really spreading. CNN: What's your hope for the future? Withers: In the way I'd like to see things, every person who is still on the streets will have medical care that comes directly to them and says, "You matter." And I'd love to see every medical school have a classroom of the streets. I've dedicated myself as much as I can to finding anyone, anywhere, who's interested in doing medical care to their own street people and helping them. Besides just the good that it does and the money that it saves, having street medicine in every community transforms us. We begin to see that we're all in this together. It's something that we should take pride in when we can actually treat people the way we would want to be treated. Want to get involved? Check out Operation Safety Net and the Street Medicine Institute to learn how you can help.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>What will happen to the prison tailor? (Opinion) - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A New York prison tailor, Joyce Mitchell, has been charged with aiding a pair of convicted murderers escape and is a likely candidate for a plea bargain</descricao>
            <corpo>Danny Cevallos is a CNN legal analyst, criminal defense attorney and partner at Cevallos &amp; Wong, practicing in Pennsylvania and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Follow him on Twitter: @CevallosLaw. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)A New York prison tailor, Joyce Mitchell, has been charged with aiding a pair of convicted murderers in escaping from a Clinton County, New York, correctional facility. Specifically, Mitchell is charged with a "class D" felony count of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation. If convicted, she faces up to eight years behind bars. This news has a lot of people asking: Why only eight years? It's a fair question, especially if the convicted killers kill again while on the run, a maximum sentence of eight years would seem light for someone who helped them escape prison. The most serious charge is the Class D felony, promoting prison contraband. Article 205 of New York Penal law deals with escape and other offenses related to custody. A felony is always a serious charge, with collateral consequences if convicted. Still, Class D felonies in New York are relatively low on the felony continuum. In fact, first-degree promotion of prison contraband, despite the high risk of harm to others in this case, is not even classified as a "violent felony" offense for sentencing. So here's the thing: Joyce Mitchell is a likely candidate for a plea bargain. This case has "early disposition" written all over it. Why? First, it's been reported she's been "cooperative" with authorities. That means she is answering questions and giving statements. Even without knowing what is contained in those statements, the kind of interviews that lead law enforcement to publicly ordain a suspect "cooperative" means that she has likely confessed. Confessions, if freely and voluntarily given, will limit your defense options drastically at trial. Second, she's the kind of defendant who doesn't go to trial. That's not meant to be disparaging. Most people don't have the stomach to gamble on a criminal trial. The statistics speak for themselves: More than 90% of defendants plead guilty rather than go to trial. Think about it -- would you risk more than double your sentence for a shot at a "not guilty"? Forget Texas Hold 'Em. Taking your criminal case to trial (especially in federal court) is the ultimate high-stakes, no-limit poker game. Most people would rather hang out in the low-risk, penny slot machine area of plea-bargaining. That includes defendants such as Mitchell. For one thing, she may have a lot to lose -- such as spending eight years in prison. Plus, she has a respect for authority that battle-hardened recidivist defendants don't have. Defendants like Mitchell usually look for an out, and early on. They are a law enforcement dream, because they cave quickly and offer plenty of information during interrogations -- or, as law enforcement prefers to call them -- "interviews." But if Mitchell were to go on trial, would she have any defenses? For now, focusing only on the felony contraband count and recognizing that we still don't know the details about the contraband, there might actually be a creative defense or two. Under New York law, a person is guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree when she knowingly and unlawfully introduces any dangerous contraband into a detention facility. It's in the definitions that a potential defense lies. "Dangerous contraband" means contraband that is capable of endangering the safety or security of a detention facility. It doesn't matter if the item is actually used for endangerment. A saw blade, for example, is capable of endangering someone's safety. It also endangered the security because it was used in the escape. But what about the word "introduce"? It's not defined in the jury instructions. Clinton County Correctional Facility offers both industrial and vocational training. What if the saw blade was already inside the prison for a lawful reason, say, in a shop or in the maintenance room? Can someone "introduce" "into" a facility a thing that is already in the facility? Or, would a court conclude that causing a saw blade to move from within a facility to another part of the facility is "introducing" it into the facility? The jury instruction as written reads like the TSA rule that says we can't "introduce" a bottle of water past security checkpoints and into the airport terminal facilities. But once we are inside, we can buy a bottle of water and take it anywhere we like within the terminal. Surely, moving items between areas of a prison is against rules and policy, but it doesn't really seem to be prohibited in the jury instructions. Then there's the word "unlawfully." A person "unlawfully" introduces dangerous contraband into a detention facility when that person has no legal right to do so. By way of example, a prison tailor might lawfully be among the few permitted to bring a pair of scissors into a prison. It's what she does with them within the prison that is problematic (like if she gave them to an inmate). But the jury instructions are silent on what happens with these items if they were initially lawfully brought into or are already within the facility walls. If this defendant smuggled in, for example, an oscillating spindle sander and a hypoid saw, and wasn't authorized to do so as a tailor, then she's got problems. But if there was a saw blade in the prison shop that she had lawful access to, and she simply facilitated the movement of the saw from one area of the facility to another, then what? Applying the language of the jury instructions, did she "unlawfully" "introduce" contraband "into" the facility? Does this activity meet the definition beyond a reasonable doubt? Depending on the facts that emerge, if the saw blades and other "contraband" were already lawfully within the facility, a defense attorney could potentially use the jury instructions to raise some reasonable doubt. Farfetched? Admittedly, yes. Perhaps there's even a New York court out there that has addressed this defense already and shot it down. But that's what defense attorneys are obligated to do -- challenge each and every element of the prosecution's case and the language of the law enacted by the legislature. Defending a criminal case at trial requires creativity, assuming the client can handle going to trial in the first place. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <cabecalho>6 new theme park rides that are worth the trip - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>U.S. theme parks are trying to lure you in by creating rides that try to do what no other ride can. Six new rides are totally worth the trip.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)They're described as "giga," "free-fly" and "wing" coasters, and they boast of being the "tallest," "fastest," you name it. All you really need to know is that more and more theme parks in the United States are trying to lure you in by creating rides that try to do what no other ride can. There are at least 16 new roller coasters across the country that have opened or are about to open this spring and summer, according to ultimaterollercoaster.com. Here are six of them that are totally worth the trip:  This ride, which opened in March, is named for the height it reaches: 325 feet, making it the tallest of the so-called giga coasters, which reach between 300 and 399 feet tall. Riders will race down the coaster's twisted 6,602-foot-long track at speeds of 95 mph, at one point passing through a "91-degree overbanked horseshoe turn." Joel Bullock, who reviews rides on coastercritic.com, said riders are momentarily lifted out of their seats several times during the ride, and then pinned down by the G-force. Be prepared for a narrow tunnel and a close fly-by with a support beam. Where it is: Carowinds; on South Carolina-North Carolina line near Charlotte. Why it's cool: This gravity-defying coaster will have you wanting to ride it again and again.  With legs dangling below the seat, riders on "Batman" are flipped head-over-heels on this 4D free-fly coaster. Six Flags says that you'll "fly like Batman" on this "wing" coaster, which has riders sit on either side of the roller coaster tracks with nothing above or below. If you're a fan of the DC Comics superhero, this ride promises to immerse you in the Batman storyline through its 4D special effects. Thrill-seekers will also be rewarded with at least four head-over-heels free-fly flips, a steep climb up a 120-foot hill, and two "beyond 90-degree raven drops." Where it is: Six Flags Fiesta Texas; San Antonio, Texas. Why it's cool: It's in 4D, it's different every time you ride it, and it has two complete vertical free falls.  Southern California recently got its first water roller coaster when the 1,000-foot-long Aqua Rocket opened this summer. Riders get into a four-person raft that's magnetically pushed down and around the coaster track, including four peaks and three "continuous rocket incline zones" going as fast as 30 mph. Despite some chilly water temperatures, reviewer Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times wrote "the zip-zip-zip uphill portions were probably the funnest part of the water coaster, in part because most water slides are a downhill-only experience." Where it is: Raging Waters Park; near Los Angeles. Why it's cool: Conveyer-belt lift instead of stairs, magnetic technology allows for cool uphill experience and you get to stay cool on a hot summer day.  This new ride combines interactivity with the thrills of a roller coaster: riders team up with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other superheroes to destroy The Joker and Lex Luthor with interactive laser blasters, and experience the first virtual loop on a dark ride. Where it is: Six Flags Over Texas near Dallas and Six Flags St. Louis. Why it's cool: It's a 4D interactive dark ride, each rider has his or her own blaster gun to fend off bad guys, and it appeals to fans of the DC Comics superheroes.  It's the world's first waterslide gaming experience, and it's called Slideboarding. As riders go down the waterslide, they try to hit targets for points by pressing colored buttons on the slide board. After the ride, they can see how they stacked up to others and try to improve their score on the next ride. You even get to pick the music that plays during your trip. Where it is: Wet N' Wild; Las Vegas. Why it's cool: Perfect for gamers and riders looking to compete with others.  This steel roller coaster has loops, rolls, "near-misses" with trees and buildings, and it'll propel you from 0-to-60 miles per hour in less than four seconds. Holiday World says the Thunderbird has the tallest vertical loop of any other wing coaster. The track spans over 3,000 feet and is 140-feet tall at its peak. Where it is: Holiday World in Santa Claus, Indiana (about an hour west of Louisville, Kentucky). Why it's cool: No shortages of rolls on this ride, plus you get to rush through the wooded terrain of Holiday World.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Psychiatrist: Holmes thought  daily about killing  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A psychiatrist testified that she couldn't stop James Holmes' obsession to kill  because he wasn't specific about his plans. </descricao>
            <corpo>Centennial, Colorado (CNN)A psychiatrist who treated James Holmes described him Tuesday as an anxious, anti-social oddball who thought obsessively about killing people in the months before he opened fire in a crowded movie theater in the Denver suburbs, killing 12 and wounding 70. Dr. Lynne Fenton testified before a packed courtroom that Holmes told her in March 2012 that he had "homicidal thoughts" -- as often as three or four times a day. As his treatment progressed, he told her his obsession with killing was only getting worse. And yet, Fenton told a jury there was little she could do because Holmes never talked about specifics. She couldn't place him under a psychiatric hold because he never disclosed his intention to kill -- even while he was acquiring weapons and "casing" a movie theater. And he never named a target, she testified.  Fenton, who headed the student mental health clinic at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, was perhaps the most anticipated witness at Holmes' capital murder trial. Courtroom spectators paid close attention as she testified on the 32nd day of a long and emotionally grueling courtroom drama. Fenton testified that she treated Holmes from mid-March until June 11, when he left her care upon flunking out of his post-graduate course in neuroscience. He walked out of her office without saying goodbye or shaking her hand, she said. Just over a month later -- on July 20, 2012 -- Holmes donned protective gear, tossed a tear gas canister into Theater 9 at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora and shot into the audience at the midnight premiere of "The Dark Knight Rises." He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If he is convicted of murder, prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty. Fenton and the university are being sued by relatives of some of the victims, and she had never before spoken publicly about her seven meetings with Holmes.  Just hours before the attack, Holmes mailed Fenton a notebook containing elaborate sketches of the theater, details of his plans, and his rationale for carrying out the shootings. He later told a court-appointed psychiatrist that it was important for people to understand. The notebook also contained Holmes' rambling thoughts about life, death and his "broken brain." He wrote that taking the lives of others would add value to his own life and keep him from committing suicide. And yet, Fenton testified, Holmes never spoke of taking his own life during his sessions with her. Nor did he talk about feeling manic or depressed or about seeing "flickerings" or other hallucinations, as he did in the notebook. He focused on how social situations caused him great anxiety, mentioned a romantic breakup and repeatedly expressed his hatred toward humanity. That dislike seemed to extend to her, Fenton said, and he did not volunteer information, responding to questions with terse, one-word answers. She said he was hostile and guarded and "wasn't very forthcoming." She suggested he might feel more comfortable with a male therapist, and brought a colleague into their later sessions. Holmes had contacted the mental health clinic in mid-March, complaining of social anxiety. He was first seen by a social worker who described him as "one of the most anxious people she had ever seen." Inside Holmes' "broken" mind  Fenton first saw him on March 21, and tentatively diagnosed him with "social anxiety" and obsessive-compulsive disorder. At their first meeting, Holmes expressed "thoughts about killing people," but Fenton said she didn't think he was dangerous. She believed his preoccupation with killing others was a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder. During one session, she said, Holmes described homicide as "a solution to the biological problem," but added "you can't kill everyone, so it's not an effective solution." Fenton said she focused on trying to build an "alliance" with Holmes so he would take his medication and keep coming back for counseling. She worried more that he would drop out of treatment, rather than carry out any plan to kill others. But the diagnosis evolved over several sessions, and she later saw signs of paranoia and psychosis. She spoke with his mother and came to believe his homicidal thoughts were longstanding, dating back to childhood. After their fourth session on April 17, she noted that he made several odd statements she didn't understand and wrote in her notes, "psychotic level thinking?" He said his homicidal obsession was "getting worse." At that session, she wrote out a prescription using the name "Hughes" rather than "Holmes," which prompted him to send an email asking "an inconvenience, Fenton?" The memo field contained a strange emoticon, a variation of the letter Q. He later apologized for his "terrible mistake," stating that the emoticon represented a fist punching the psychiatrist in the eye. "Violence, is that what you need to hear?" he asked, according to Fenton's testimony. She said she didn't fully understand what he meant, but added that he expressed concerned he would be "locked up." Ex-girlfriend recounts how Holmes sent message about taking lives  In May, Holmes spoke of reading about the Unabomber and the "Tylenol terrorist." She learned that he had failed a course and would leave school. He said he could no longer afford treatment. He seemed to have a plan, saying he had money in the bank, would get a job and could count on his parents for financial support. "It sounded like he was functioning well and looking ahead to the future," Fenton testified. She added that he didn't seem depressed or angry and expressed "no thoughts of hurting himself." By June 11, his last session, Holmes seemed to have developed more of an angry edge, and challenged her, saying she was afraid of him and didn't like him. Fenton did not call police, but she did get in touch with the campus threat assessment team. She also called Holmes' mother and learned he had been troubled for many years. Fenton testified that she asked Holmes if he intended to act on his homicidal impulses, and he said he did not plan to take action. The notebook he mailed her told a different story. "If the defendant had told you about buying weapons and making plans, would you have acted differently?" prosecutor George Brauchler asked. "Yes," the psychiatrist responded, "it would have shown me he had a plan and intent, not just homicidal thoughts." Prosecutors said they may finish their case by the end of the week. Holmes told psychiatrist he has 'regrets' over shootings CNN's Ana Cabrera contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>New discovery changes strategy to fix sinkhole Corvette - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>When GM restorers were fixing a unique Corvette that fell down a sinkhole, they found autoworkers' signatures underneath nearly every part.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For Corvette lovers it's sort of like a painter being asked to touch up the "Mona Lisa." Because — like Leonardo da Vinci's painting — there's only one 1 millionth Corvette. Restoring the white, 1992 LT1 convertible roadster doesn't really come with as much pressure as that, said Dave Bolognino with a laugh. "But we don't take it lightly." Bolognino, director of design fabrications operations at General Motors, is helping restore one of eight priceless 'Vettes swallowed by a sinkhole last year at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The stakes are high, because hard-core 'Vette fans care. They've made it one of the most collected cars in the nation. Globally, the Corvette has become — in GM's words — the "world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car," since it debuted in 1953. The 1 millionth 'Vette paid homage to that '53 model, because both cars share the same black soft-top, white paint job and red interior color scheme. So far, Bolognino and his colleagues at GM's design facility in Warren, Michigan, have restored about 15-20% of the car. They've got the car running and fixed its structural damage. That's pretty impressive based on disturbing photos GM released last year that showed the car battered and caked with dirt. You could almost hear the Corvette Nation shake its head and whisper, "Good luck with that." When members of the restoration team rolled up their sleeves and took the car apart for the first time last April, they discovered a surprise. Hundreds of them, actually. The surfaces underneath nearly every part were "absolutely covered with signatures," Bolognino said. The GM assembly line workers at the Bowling Green factory who rolled the car out in July of 1992, had signed it. They signed it in virtually every hidden place — under the carpet, under the side panels, under the dash pad. Each signature amounted to a personal salute from hundreds of proud men and women honoring their work and the museum piece they helped create. "We said, 'OK, that changes our strategy,'" said Bolognino. From then on, the team decided to focus even harder on saving every piece of the car — even the most damaged parts. "Somebody took the time to write their name on the undercarriage. We need to take the time to make sure that we straighten that piece of metal instead of replacing it," he said. So, can GM's design experts bring this car back from the dead? They've got to wrestle with some big challenges, including:    Perhaps surprisingly, the total parts lost on the car are relatively few. "The parts we need to replace, you can probably count on two or three hands, maybe," Bolognino said. "The front bumper cover was a total loss. But fortunately there were no signatures on that."  Back at the museum in Bowling Green, officials have asked GM to save any stray original parts that aren't used for the restoration. Those parts will likely end up in an exhibit — or sold as fundraiser items, museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli said. "You may see parts of that car on eBay," she joked. "You never know!" The 1 millionth is one of three cars experts said were salvageable from the disaster. Last year GM unveiled a restored 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil that fell victim to the hole. A third car, a 1962 convertible, remains at the museum — its tuxedo black paint job still dusty and dented. The museum intends to restore the '62 on its own. GM says it no longer has the institutional knowledge required to properly put it back in shape. Frassinelli said the museum is hoping to build a restoration and maintenance facility where visitors would be able to watch experts work on the '62 and other aging 'Vettes. Related story: First sinkhole Corvette restored It has been 16 months since the cars got sunk by the sinkhole. And the museum has nearly finished repairing the floor of the 140-foot diameter yellow Skydome, where the ground opened up. The dome's 11-story red spire — a longtime landmark visible along nearby Interstate 65 — has been patched, cleaned and painted, all the way down to its 20-foot-wide base. Engineers say the dome is on track to reopen by early July. Inside the dome, workers have covered the hole with concrete and made the surface safe with a connected grid system of micropiles and concrete beams, Frassinelli said. "If the cave were ever to collapse in the future, the floor's gonna stay put." The museum plans to install an underground camera and lights so visitors can get a look at the hole that did so much damage. Frassinelli credited the sinkhole for an upward trend in museum attendance that continues to rise. The number of visitors so far this year, she said, is tracking higher than the same period last year. The museum is still deciding which cars to display in the dome. A new exterior door and interior display configuration will make it easier to get cars in and out, Frassinelli said. Before the sinkhole, moving cars around inside the Skydome was "kind of like Jenga, or something," she joked. Thanks to the improvements, it will be easier, she said, and the dome will be able to hold a few more cars. The 1 millionth Corvette is expected to be fully restored by Labor Day weekend, September 5-7 — just in time for the museum's 21st anniversary celebration. "We're very confident that we'll get it finished for that," Bolognini said. "We'll make sure the car is right."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Rachel Dolezal's brother: She's 'making up more lies' - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A brother of former NAACP chapter president Rachel Dolezal challenges her story, especially her insistence there's no proof about her biological parents.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Ezra Dolezal would love to see his sister, Rachel, take a DNA test to prove whose version of the truth about her racial identity is the right one. But he doesn't think she will. Rachel Dolezal has gone from a Spokane, Washington, activist to the focus of a highly charged national debate in recent days, after reports surfaced that she was born white yet has claimed she is black. Amid the controversy, she resigned Monday as head of her local NAACP chapter and, a day later, spoke out extensively for the first time in an interview with NBC. And she didn't back down when it comes how she sees herself, even after her parents shared childhood photos of a young Rachel Dolezal -- her pale complexion and straight blond hair in contrast to the woman with darker skin and dark curly hair who appeared on NBC. For the family, one comment stung especially hard. "I haven't had a DNA test," Dolezal said. "There's been no biological proof that Larry and Ruthanne are my biological parents." Ex-NAACP leader stands by self-assessment as black woman Larry and Ruthanne are the Montana couple who helped drive this story, telling reporters that Rachel is their estranged daughter. Ezra Dolezal is himself biracial and one of four children adopted by the Dolezals -- unlike Rachel, his older sister by 15 years, he says. "I guarantee that she is not going to take a DNA test to prove that (Larry and Ruthanne Dolezal) are not her parents," Ezra Dolezal told CNN's "New Day" on Wednesday. "Because they are, and she doesn't want to be caught going back on her story again."  Over the years, several reports have come out identifying Rachel Dolezal as transracial, multiracial or black. She hasn't corrected them -- in part because, it seems, she feels connected with the African-American experience, a link she claims began as early as age 5, when she drew self-portraits in brown instead of peach crayon and with black, curly hair. "I identify as black," she told NBC's Matt Lauer. This self-assessment, though, has bothered some -- including African-Americans who feel that Dolezal advanced as an activist by misrepresenting herself and by claiming personal injustices that weren't legitimate coming from a woman who could decide any day to present herself as white again. She has had her defenders, too, with some pointing to the good she's done as an activist and saying she shouldn't be faulted for her tight bond with the black community. #AskRachel and more: Social media love, hate Dolezal  For all the Internet outrage, though, the ones most directly affected by all this are the Dolezals. And they couldn't be further apart. It has been years since Rachel Dolezal talked with her parents. They've been on opposing sides of one custody battle, which ended with Rachel taking in one of Larry and Ruthanne's four adopted children as her own. And Rachel, who attended historically black Howard University and until very recently had taught classes on African-American culture at Eastern Washington University, has claimed she felt her connection with the black experience was stifled when she was growing up. "I felt very isolated with my identity virtually my entire life, that nobody really got it and that I really didn't have the personal agency to express it," she told NBC. "I kind of imagined that maybe at some point (I'd have to) own it publicly and discuss this kind of complexity." Dolezal puts hair questions to rest Yet her parents have challenged her assertions, including that she identified with African-Americans as a youngster or was held back in any way. They've challenged her integrity and even questioned her mental state. Ezra Dolezal backed his adopted parents Wednesday, while ripping what he called a web of lies -- a web that, he said, is growing bigger by the day. "I think ... she's too nervous to just admit that she's not been telling the truth," he said. "(That) is why she keeps on making up more and more lies to help fit the story as it goes." Opinion: Dolezal has a right to be black  </corpo>

A best-selling author, he is also founder of Green for All, a national organization working to build a green economy. Follow him on Twitter @VanJones68. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)In their rush to punish African-Americans for exercising their First Amendment rights and pushing an end to oppressive law enforcement tactics, defenders of police brutality have lost all touch with common sense. "As Violence Spikes in Some Cities, Is 'Ferguson Effect' to Blame?" asks NBC News. "How many New Yorkers must die before the mayor brings back stop-and-frisk?" blares the New York Post. In the Wall Street Journal, longtime defender of bad cops Heather MacDonald penned an utterly misleading piece on "The New Nationwide Crime Wave" blaming agitation on the part of those upset about the criminal justice system's failure to hold police responsible for the killing of innocent citizens. The strategy is simple. First, gin up fears of a new nationwide crime epidemic with cherry-picked or misleading stats. Second, blame the supposed epidemic on protests against police violence or on reforms of policing tactics long sought by black, brown and poor Americans. Just don't provide any objective evidence of a link. Do not be fooled -- this is nothing more than a deliberate campaign to demean Americans for daring to speak out against unlawful police violence. Apologists for law enforcement brutality start with hyperbolic claims about a new nationwide crime epidemic. But their arguments are hilariously riddled with holes. For starters, Heather MacDonald's piece is a classic example of how apologists cherry-pick the data. Even if crime is increasing in some cities, what about all the others? If it has jumped in certain neighborhoods, what about the others? Is crime staying flat? Is it decreasing? The people shouting loudest about an all-expansive crime wave never say. Here is something else they never say: Crime reached historically low levels in 2013 and 2014 in many places. So any increase in 2015 is more likely to be a simple "return to the mean." Like a ball bouncing down the stairs, the yearly numbers will go up and down even as crime rates decline overall. I could go on. Overall crime is actually down 6.6% in New York City. Small numbers are routinely twisted into scary statistics -- one murder in 2014 and three in 2015 could mean violence levels are historically low, but still be presented as a misleading "300% increase." And statistics are often given completely false interpretations. The New York Post recently claimed: "You are 45% more likely to be murdered in Bill de Blasio's Manhattan," basing their claim on an increase in murders from 11 to 16. This is hysterically bad math. Even if the increase is something other than statistical noise, someone needs to explain to them that a 45% increase does not make every single person 45% more likely to face violence. I'm reminded of the old Mark Twain line, of unknown origin: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics." What then of claims that this alleged "crime wave" is the fault of protesters in Ferguson, Baltimore, Cleveland, and elsewhere? Or that it is the inevitable result of curtailing mass racial profiling and unconstitutional stopping and searching of African-American, Latino, or poor Americans? These claims are even more flimsy. MacDonald does not even try. She says "the most plausible explanation" is agitation against police departments, but provides exactly zero evidence of this fact. None at all. Let us actually examine the evidence. The Ferguson protests erupted in the summer of 2014. But by MacDonald's own admission, crime continued to decrease through the end of the year. Shouldn't we have an immediate increase, if African-Americans were to blame for lawlessness? Or take stop-and-frisk in New York. From 2011 to 2013, the number of police stops dropped by 75%, but the number of shootings and murders also decreased, by 29%. Murder in New York City was at a historic low in 2013. In 2014, in de Blasio's first year in office police stops declined, and yet the murder rate also fell to another historic low. For better or worse, stop-and frisk has not disappeared, it has simply been curtailed. For more than a decade, the NYPD stopped nearly 4 million people, most of them with black or brown skin. And the gun recovery rate was a pathetic 0.016%. Last year, police stopped only 46,235, but 18% resulted in an arrest or summons, up from 12% in 2013. And even now, black leaders point out that innocent people are still caught up in the police dragnet. Finally -- say that there is, in fact, an increase in crime. Could it not simply be statistical noise after historic lows the past years? Could it have something to do with the eighth year of a struggling economy in which unemployment in communities of color is double that of white America? Could it have something to do with an unseasonably warm year, with more young men out in the streets earlier than ever? Apologists for police abuse never say. Instead they make the far more tenuous leap that violence must be the result of hurting the feelings of police. I have no doubt that some police officers feel slighted. And I am also sure that great teachers are hurt when their entire profession is attacked. America's public servants who protect us abroad, preserve our air and water, and help our seniors with Social Security undoubtedly suffer low morale when they are criticized. But they continue to do their jobs, and no one blames those who spoke up for bad results. By contrast, today, there is compelling evidence and local citizen complaints of deliberate slowdowns on the part of police. If police stopped and frisked entire Tea Party rallies to catch one militia member, there would be unending screams of oppression. If teens in tricorner hats and "don't tread on me" shirts were stopped, arrested, beaten, or murdered by law enforcement, it would be widely agreed that it represented government tyranny. And yet, this has been the reality for many black communities for decades. And when we engage in our constitutional right to protest, the same people who profess to love the Constitution so much declare us responsible for a new nationwide crime wave that may not even exist. It would be laughable -- if it were not so despicable. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.  </corpo>

            <descricao>In Keyana Tahmaseb's surrealist photo series "Human Canvas," people appear to fade into their surroundings.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Our surroundings in domestic life and daily routines can comfort us, providing stability and consistency amid the chaos of our busy lives. However, surroundings can also trap us, become mundane and make us feel awash in sameness. Keyana Tahmaseb explores the idea of feeling trapped and fading into one's surroundings in her surrealist photo series "Human Canvas." In this series, the subjects literally blend with settings and objects through paint and other materials. Tahmaseb initially took inspiration from Irving Penn's 1949 photo "Girl in Bed," which depicts a woman lying facedown on a bed wearing a night gown that matches the sheets. "I wanted to play with this idea of invisibility and blending in," she said. For her first photo in the series -- No. 3 in the gallery above -- Tahmaseb painted a woman's back to match a rose-printed bedsheet. Tahmaseb said this image was completely inspired by Penn, and from there she let the concept grow, moving to wallpapers, objects and even a lumber mill. The photos hide the subjects' faces, either by looking away from the viewer or being covered. "I feel like without a face, it's more relatable," Tahmaseb said. "You can't exactly tell how old they are or what they look like." Her idea was to enhance the feeling of invisibility, "which is something that's relatable to everyone." Though Tahmaseb's series is not completely free from Photoshop retouching, most of each image was created without digital manipulation. Each photo took between two to six hours to set up and shoot. She wanted to be completely hands-on with this series, including putting together props and sets. She also painted the subjects herself. Tahmaseb describes herself growing up with a paintbrush in one hand and a drawing pencil in the other, spending much of her grade school and college years in art classes. In "Human Canvas," she combines her multimedia background as a photographer and a painter. "I love being able to do all these different things within one project," Tahmaseb said. "I hate saying I'm a photographer sometimes, because I feel like I'm more than that. Painting on people, they become my sculptures." She began this project while studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York. After she began the series by painting her subjects, her classmates challenged her to try using other materials to turn her models into chameleons. This included covering herself with birthday cake in a self-portrait and covering one subject in mud at a lumber mill. With the busyness of patterns and textures in the photos, Tahmaseb keeps things simple stylistically. She uses natural lighting as much as possible, occasionally relying on studio lights if the photo calls for more drama. She also keeps the frame free of anything besides the subjects and their settings. "I wanted you to see most of the body, and I wanted to leave some negative space so that it's not too much with the patterns," she said. "I like my images to look pretty clean and not too suffocating." "Human Canvas" is a window into something that can be felt, but not always explained -- an examination of this trapped feeling through dreamlike images. "I'm creating these little worlds, these little sets. In a way these images are theatrical, even cinematic," Tahmaseb described. "They are a frozen moment in time of the surreal and psychological from this little world." Tahmaseb said that she plans to continue the series, pushing it in new directions through different materials and surroundings. Keyana Tahmaseb is a photographer based in New York.

            <corpo>Centennial, Colorado (CNN)For the fifth time in eight days, the judge in the James Holmes murder trial has dismissed a juror. Judge Carlos Samour on Wednesday dismissed juror No. 267, saying that person was not forthcoming with him about having recognized a witness who testified on May 5. This is the fifth juror to be dismissed in the trial, which has run for about seven weeks. Nineteen jurors are left, 12 of whom will decide the case. Holmes, 27, a former doctoral student in neuroscience, is standing trial on charges of capital murder and other offenses. He is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 more at a midnight showing of "The Dark Knight Rises" in Aurora, Colorado, on July 20, 2012. He faces 165 counts. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Psychiatrist: Holmes thought 3-4 times a day about killing  </corpo>

            <descricao>Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year. "There is no stronger bond between man and dog than that formed during war," Farthing said at the annual tribute show, which aired Sunday night on CNN's global networks. The star-studded event, held in New York at the American Museum of Natural History, honored the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2014 -- everyday people making extraordinary efforts to change the world. Of those 10, CNN's audience voted Farthing as the Hero of the Year. "Wow, I am absolutely at a loss for words," Farthing said as he accepted the award. "This is absolutely amazing. I would really like to thank everybody who voted for the Nowzad charity and what we do in Afghanistan and believing in us. And I would also like to thank all the other heroes in this room for doing what they do to make this world an absolute better place. Thank you guys for doing what you do. Thank you." In addition to the $25,000 that each person receives for making the Top 10, Farthing will be awarded $100,000 for his cause. The inspiration for Nowzad Dogs came in 2006. When Farthing helped break up a dogfight in the town of Nowzad, Afghanistan, the Royal Marine sergeant didn't think much of it. The war-torn town was overrun with dogs. But when one of those dogs followed him back to base, it was hard to tell who rescued whom. "As the troop sergeant, I was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job. ... But no one was doing that for me," Farthing said earlier this year. "My time with this dog was a way of de-stressing, collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game." After his tour ended, Farthing went through a difficult process to get Nowzad home to Britain. Realizing he wasn't the only one, he soon founded Nowzad Dogs to help other soldiers whose lives were turned around by the animals they befriended. Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in Afghanistan. The group's shelter and clinic in Kabul are staffed by 14 Afghan nationals, four of whom are trained veterinarians. The group spays and neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population. In turn, those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets. To date, Nowzad Dogs has reunited nearly 700 soldiers with the animals they adopted in Afghanistan. "I know that the dog I looked after was my saving grace from the stress of conflict," Farthing said. "And because of that initial bond, the work goes on: reuniting soldiers with their companions, tackling rabies and training veterinarians in Kabul. I would like to thank everybody for their support. We're making a difference for the Afghan people, the soldiers and one dog and cat at a time." Celebrity presenters at the tribute show this year included actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Christina Hendricks, Taye Diggs, Rosie Perez, Uzo Aduba and John Leguizamo. Also appearing were comedian Kathy Griffin, musician Questlove of The Roots, Kelly Ripa of "Live with Kelly and Michael" and Morgan Spurlock of CNN's "Inside Man." The event included musical performances by Sheryl Crow and Trisha Yearwood. Yearwood performed her latest song, "PrizeFighter," while Crow performed "Wide River to Cross" with CNN Hero Arthur Bloom and his MusiCorps Wounded Warrior Band. Musician Nick Jonas, actor Tyler James Williams and actress Quvenzhane Wallis were also on hand to present awards to remarkable "young wonders" who are doing their part to help change their communities. The stories of this year's Top 10 Heroes, who were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN, can be found at CNNHeroes.com. Through Amazon Payments, anyone who wants to contribute can make a direct charitable donation to a Hero's designated nonprofit until December 31. Since 2007, the CNN Heroes campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com. It has also received more than 50,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. As part of their award package, each of the Top 10 CNN Heroes will also receive organizational training through the Annenberg Foundation, a global supporter of nonprofit organizations. All 10 Heroes will participate in customized versions of the Annenberg Alchemy program, tailored to help grow their individual organizations.  Arthur Bloom Arthur Bloom has used the healing power of music to help hundreds of injured soldiers recover their lives. His program, MusiCorps, pairs professional musicians with troops recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, helping them play instruments and write and record music. "By injecting music into this space, we can inject life," Bloom said. "There's nothing injured about the way they do it. It's just good music."

Since 2006, his nonprofit, Lionsraw, has engaged more than 500 volunteers in construction projects and educational programs that have benefited nearly 6,000 children. "We're trying to harness the passion of football fans to make a difference," he said.

            <descricao>Charles "Chase" Merritt, the man accused of killing four members of the McStay family in 2010, will stand trial, a California judge rules.</descricao>
            <corpo>San Bernardino, California (CNN)The man accused of killing four members of the McStay family in 2010 will stand trial, a California judge ruled Monday. Judge Michael A. Smith determined there was sufficient evidence to try Charles "Chase" Merritt on four counts of murder for the bludgeoning deaths of Joseph and Summer McStay and their two young boys. Merritt has pleaded not guilty. He was a former business partner of Joseph McStay, who sold outdoor water displays over the Internet. The 2010 disappearance of the McStays has been one of Southern California's most enduring mysteries. Heartbreaking details of how the family died emerged at Monday's preliminary hearing for Merritt, who was arrested late last year. Desert deaths mystery: Five questions about the McStay case One after another, half a dozen detectives and FBI agents took the witness stand in San Bernardino Superior Court to provide the details of the family's violent end. They told how the McStays -- Joseph, Summer and their sons Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3 -- were bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer and buried in shallow graves in the high desert outside Victorville, northeast of Los Angeles. For a time after their disappearance, the McStays were believed to have taken off on an extended vacation to Mexico. But the details didn't add up: Eggs were left on a kitchen counter and the house was being renovated. The family dogs were left, tethered and unfed, in the backyard. And then in November 2013, their skeletal remains were found in two shallow graves in the desert. None of the victims was wearing shoes, authorities testified. All died of blunt force trauma. Suspect no stranger to family Summer and Gianni were found in "Grave B," as investigators dubbed it, along Interstate 15 near Victorville; her husband lay in "Grave A," along with the scattered bones of the younger boy, Joseph Jr. Grave B also held what authorities say was the murder weapon: a 3-pound Stanley sledgehammer. Investigators believe it came from the family's home in Fallbrook in San Diego County. Joseph and Summer's skulls had been smashed multiple times. The boys' skulls were fractured as well -- Gianni's as many as seven times, according to testimony. Joseph had a broken leg and rib. He was tied with an extension cord and wrapped in a futon cover taken from the Fallbrook house, a detective testified. The evidence heard so far seems to indicate the family was accosted and perhaps even bludgeoned to death at home. Signs of renovation work -- paint and new hardwood flooring -- were found in the open kitchen and family room. Summer McStay wore no top when her body was unearthed, and her bra was spattered with paint. The paint color matched the paint found in the home, according to testimony. The sledge hammer contained smears of the same paint. Merritt was among the first to raise the alert about the missing McStays. He told their family he couldn't reach McStay and helped a brother search the house. 'I have absolutely no clue' on McStay family's slaying, Merritt said in interview Although Merritt denied he'd ever driven the family's Isuzu Trooper, his DNA was found on the steering wheel and gear shift. The truck was found abandoned near the Mexican border soon after the family disappeared. Judge Smith also heard from an FBI agent who analyzed phone records. He found 27 calls between Merritt and Joseph McStay on February 4, 2010 -- the last day the family was seen alive. Merritt called McStay five times the next day, but none the day after that, February 6. On that morning, Merritt's phone pinged off cell towers in the Victorville area, where the graves were unearthed three years later. Prosecutors on Monday also began to home in on a possible motive: money. A detective testified about several checks written to Merritt on McStay's business accounting software. They were written after the family disappeared but were backdated to February 4, 2010. The checks were printed but deleted from the software. They were deposited to an account Merritt set up on February 3. Asked about the checks, Merritt offered no explanation or gave conflicting stories, a detective testified. Merritt has previously spoken to the media about his relationship with the McStays and professed his innocence. Prosecutors ended their case Monday by citing an interview Merritt gave CNN's Randi Kaye before his arrest, in which he said, "I am definitely the last person [Joseph McStay] saw." In his ruling, the judge found the backdated checks and DNA in the Isuzu to be compelling evidence to hold Merritt for trial. He also noted that in interviews with police after the McStays' disappearance, Merritt referred to the McStays in the past tense. The cell phone pings near the grave sites on February 6 and tire tracks consistent with Merritt's Chevy pickup also support inference of his involvement in the crime, the judge found.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The U.S. Air Force could be sending some of its most advanced warplanes to Europe in a show of force against Russian actions in Ukraine and elsewhere around the continent, the service's top civilian said Monday. "The biggest threat on my mind is what's happening with Russia and the activities of Russia," Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James said during a visit to the Paris Air Show. "It's extremely worrisome on what's going on in the Ukraine." James' remarks were reported by Military.com, Breaking Defense and other websites. For months, the Pentagon has been rotating aircraft through Europe for exercises with allies under Operation Atlantic Resolve, which it calls "America's commitment to European security." Participating in those exercises and rotations have been B-2 and B-52 bombers, F-15Cs and A-10 attack planes as well as Army and Navy assets. James said the F-22 Raptor, the Pentagon's premier fighter, could join that list. "I could easily see the day -- though I couldn't tell you the day exactly -- when the F-22, for example, rotates in is a possibility. I don't see why that couldn't happen in the future," James said, according to Military.com. The stealthy F-22s, which became operational in 2005 but only saw their first combat in attacks on ISIS positions in Syria late last year, can be configured to attack other aircraft or bomb ground targets. "The F-22 cannot be matched by any known or projected fighter aircraft," says the Air Force's fact sheet for the Raptor, which costs about $143 million each. That would include what Russia currently puts in the air.Russian reaction to James' remarks came through state-sponsored media Sputnik International. One posting on the Sputnik website called any threat from Russia "fictional." Another said Moscow would make moves of its own if the F-22s were deployed. "Their deployment will certainly be an additional impetus for Moscow to speed up the process of developing and putting on service the Russian response, the fifth-generation T-50 fighter," Sputnik quoted Vladimir Batyuk, from the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as saying. U.S. and Russian forces have had several close calls around Europe since Russian forces took Crimea from the Ukraine in 2014 and supported rebels in other areas of the former Soviet bloc state. Late last month, a Russian fighter jet, flying at high speed, came within 10 feet of a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea, U.S. officials told CNN. That close call came weeks after another incident between the U.S. and Russia over the skies of Europe, when a U.S. RC-135U flying a routine route in international airspace was intercepted by a Russian Su-27 Flanker in what authorities called an "unsafe and unprofessional manner." And earlier this month, the U.S. Navy took the unusual step of releasing video of Russian Su-24 aircraft flying past the right side of the guided missile destroyer USS Ross in the Black Sea.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Dirty bomb: does ISIS seek ultimate threat?  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Last week, news emerged that ISIS terrorists have reportedly obtained radioactive materials in Iraq with a view to developing a radioactive "dirty bomb."</descricao>
            <corpo>Matthew Moran is deputy director, and Christopher Hobbs is co-director of the the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King's College London, specializing on issues related to nuclear proliferation and security. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. (CNN)Last week, the news emerged that ISIS terrorists have reportedly obtained radioactive materials from hospitals and research facilities captured in Iraq with a view to developing a radioactive "dirty bomb." Unsurprisingly, the prospect of ISIS dabbling with unconventional weapons has been greeted with considerable concern. The Iraqi government has appealed to the United Nations for international help to "stave off the threat" in this regard and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop recently acknowledged that NATO countries are deeply concerned by the situation. But what can ISIS actually do with these newly acquired radioactive materials? What is the nature of the threat? First off, it is important to emphasize that radioactive sources of the type acquired by ISIS cannot be used to create a nuclear bomb. These sources are mostly used for medical research and treatments such as radiotherapy, and are completely unsuited to the development of nuclear weapons. This said, the harmful effects of these sources, stemming from their chemical toxicity and radioactive properties, can be exploited in other ways. If inhaled or ingested, for example, these materials can be lethal. This was evidenced by the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, when just a fraction of a gram of radioactive polonium proved enough to kill the former KGB officer. Fortunately, achieving this type of internal exposure on a large scale would prove enormously challenging for a terrorist group. Consequently, attention has focused on the use of these materials by ISIS in a dirty bomb. Combining radioactive materials with conventional explosives, this is a bomb with an edge. A dirty bomb would spread radioactive materials, contaminating the local area and any individuals in the nearby vicinity. Crucially, however, this contamination would be mostly external in nature and, if the attack was promptly identified as being radioactive, decontamination of individuals would be a relatively straightforward process. The exposure time of anyone affected would be limited and the negative health effects mitigated. Indeed, with a dirty bomb, members of the public are more likely to be harmed by the impact of the conventional explosives than that of the radioactive materials. This point was borne out by a series of tests conducted over a four-year period by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in the Negev Desert. As part of this project - details of which were recently published by Haaretz -- some 20 devices laced with radioactive materials were detonated and their effects observed. The IDF concluded that a dirty bomb attack poses little physical danger beyond the conventional blast. The real threat from dirty bombs lies in their psychological and economic effects -- a fact that often sees these devices described as weapons of mass disruption rather than weapons of mass destruction. From a psychological perspective, for example, nuclear weapons are associated with death and destruction on an enormous scale, and dirty bombs benefit from association with these more sophisticated weapons simply because they incorporate radioactive materials. There is an important distinction to be made between nuclear and radiological materials but this is often lost in media reports and commentary on these issues. In any case, a dirty bomb detonated in a major urban center would be sure to cause widespread fear and panic. The economic costs associated with a dirty bomb would also be considerable. A 2011 Congressional Research Service report, for example, suggested that the clean-up after such an attack could figure in the billions of dollars, if detonated in a high-value area such as city center or port. Little wonder, then, that the security of radiological sources has emerged as a politically salient issue in recent years. Ultimately, while the thought of ISIS using dirty bombs to further its terrorist agenda is unsettling, the threat should not be exaggerated, particularly when it comes to its impact on public health. These are not the nuclear weapons that ISIS supposedly desires, and will do nothing to further the group's ambitions in this regard.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)One of two North Carolina teens injured in a weekend shark attack said he had little warning of what was to come. "I didn't see it coming," Hunter Treschl said from his bed at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington. "I was just in about waist-deep water, playing with my cousin ... and felt this kind of hit on my left leg ... like it was a big fish coming near you or something," the 16-year-old said in a series of videos released by the hospital. "Then it just kind of hit my arm. That was the first I saw it, when it was biting up my left arm."  Hunter was one of two teens who lost their arms in the waters off Oak Island on Sunday. His arm was amputated below the shoulder. Thirteen-year-old Kiersten Yow was the first swimmer attacked. She lost her arm at the elbow. The shark also bit her leg. The two attacks took place about 90 minutes apart. Kiersten's parents, Brian and Laurie Yow, said in a statement that their daughter was transferred from New Hanover to N.C. Children's Hospital in Chapel Hill on Monday, where"she remains in stable condition and is receiving excellent care." Her road to recovery will be long and will include surgeries and rehabilitation, they said, "but her doctors at (the University of North Carolina) expect she will keep her leg and for that we are grateful."  To have two shark attacks so close together is extremely rare, one expert said. "Having a series of injuries so close to each other in time and space makes this unusual," said George Burgess, an ichthyologist and fisheries biologist with the Florida Museum of Natural History. "It might suggest a single shark has been involved." Only three times in the four decades that he's been studying sharks has Burgess seen attacks happen "so closely in time and space," he said. The other incidents occurred in Egypt and Florida. Still Burgess said, shark attacks are unusual. Last year saw 72 attacks worldwide, only three of them were fatal. In a typical year, about four or five people are bitten by sharks on North Carolina beaches. Shark attack kills woman in Maui  Hunter said he was working to stay positive. "I've lost my arm obviously, so I have kind of two options," he said. "I can try to live my life the way I was and make an effort to do that even though I don't have an arm or I can kind of just let this be completely debilitating and bring my life down and ruin it." Hunter said he chooses to "fight and live a normal life" despite losing his arm. Messages of support have helped maintain his positive outlook. "I've gotten a massive amount of messages from people all over who've wished me well," he said. Hunter said he can't wait to get back home to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to see his friends.

They said their daughter, who reportedly earned a master's degree from the historically black Howard University in Washington, D.C., and is a professor of Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University, began to "disguise herself" as black after the family adopted four African-American children. Don't get me wrong, I am a proud black woman who grew up in a family that is incredibly diverse and has such a heritage of hues that my parents were once questioned in a store as to where they "got that white baby from," as they carted around my fair-skinned and light-eyed infant nephew. But with all the heated debate over race relations and the treatment of minorities by law enforcement, which has resulted in unrest and more than a few black mothers burying their sons and daughters, I was both flabbergasted and intrigued by any claim that a white woman would willingly pass as black.  The concept of "passing" is something many African-Americans are familiar with. Some members of my own family were so light-skinned, with European features, that they willingly chose to live as white rather than deal with the discrimination of being black in America. My mother, Patricia, who is fair and has greenish-gray eyes, tells the story of when her grandmother arrived at the bank where my mother worked after it closed. My biracial great-grandmother, Rose Evans, knocked on the window as my mother stood next to her white co-worker, counting out their drawer. "There's a woman trying to get your attention," the co-worker told my mother. When my mother responded "I know. That's just my grandmother," the co-worker continued: "No. There's a white woman trying to get your attention." "No. That's my grandmother," my mother repeated as her co-worker turned bright red with embarrassment. The truth of the matter is that when it comes to race, you just can't tell from looking. One of my closest friends, Jill Hudson, is a stunning woman and the product of two African-American parents. Yet she is so light, with straight hair, that when I excitedly shared with Baltimore Sun co-workers that "a new, black reporter" had been hired to cover police in Howard County, I was asked, when she showed up for her first day on the job: "Where is the new black reporter?"  With her bright blue eyes, white skin and sandy colored hair, my great-grandmother could have chosen to walk away from her family and pursue a life where no one need ever know that she was a black woman. Instead, she chose to marry (more than once) black men and give birth to children who ranged from "white looking" to brown. Not all took that path. In her book "A Chosen Exile: A History of Racial Passing in American Life," historian Allyson Hobbs tells the stories of those who shunned family and heritage for the perceived better life that being white offered. She wrote the book, Hobbs told NPR, after learning she had a cousin she never knew whose mother sent her from Chicago to California in search of a better life because she could pass for white. The plan was so successful that when the cousin learned her father had died, she declined to come to the funeral, telling her family, "I can't. I'm a white woman now." "Her mother really felt that this was the very best thing she could do for her daughter," Hobbs told NPR. "She felt this was a way to offer opportunities to her daughter that she wouldn't have living as a black woman on the South Side of Chicago." Suffice it to say those are some of the tangled roots from which the collective black family tree springs, and this is why Dolezal's story has sparked everything from outrage to amusement to praise for her being an "ally" of the black community. But to some, even the conversation surrounding Dolezal felt like just another example of white privilege. As one person tweeted, "Only a white person could get this much attention for being black." Beyond all this, there are many questions surrounding Dolezal. Is she in fact white, or is there a family secret, a la Lacey Schwartz, a Harvard Law School graduate turned filmmaker who grew up believing she was white and Jewish before learning she was actually black? (Schwartz tells her story in her documentary "Little White Lie.") Or was this some type of years-long social experiment, as my Facebook friend Robin Greene dubbed it --"Black Like Me: The new Millennia Edition," referencing the book by white journalist John Howard Griffin who in the 1950s disguised himself as a black man and traveled through the racially segregated South? At the very least, Dolezal has added a new chapter to the already heated discussions about race and appropriation of black culture that has dogged celebrities for years, most recently rapper Iggy Azalea. A native Australian, Azalea has become the new poster girl for the complaint that white artists are quick to snatch up black art forms (hip-hop for her, R&amp;B for Elvis), sanitize them to make them more appealing for the masses (read "white") and laugh all the way to the bank. "White rappers are always difficult to comprehend, difficult to deal with," Amy Zimmerman wrote for The Daily Beast. "Eminem pissed off a lot of people by using the N-word, and you're not a real hip-hop fan if you're not still processing Kendrick Lamar's 2013 Grammy defeat at the extremely white hands of Macklemore. But Iggy Azalea is a special case: her story falls at the intersection of race, gender, commodification and co-option, and speaks to a history of black erasure that many artists feel they can no longer afford to ignore." As with anything connected to race, the story of Dolezal is complicated. Our times are touted as "post-racial," even as economic disparity between the races remains plain to see and we continue to debate "the n-word" -- most recently, for example, when actor Tom Hanks' son Chester Hanks went on a rant defending his use of the racial epithet. If Dolezal did indeed successfully pass as a black woman for years, many will resent her, and this is easily understandable. In doing so, she will have provided further credence to the conservative narrative that affirmative action and attempts to level the racial playing field have clearly given blacks some type of advantage over others. Then there is the issue of how being "transracial" is not an option readily available to most of us of color who must still live our lives in a society where some continue to view us as "less than." Don't look for Dolezal to get a pass from black people on this one. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Jurassic World's missed opportunity (Opinion) - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The new movie 'Jurassic World' misses an opportunity to bring more life-like, interesting dinosaurs to the big screen.</descricao>
            <corpo>Darren Naish is a vertebrate paleontologist affiliated with the University of Southampton, UK. He blogs for Scientific American and is the author of "The Great Dinosaur Discoveries." You can follow him @TetZoo. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)More than 20 years have passed since Steven Spielberg's "Jurassic Park" hit the big screen. I'm a scientist who studies, writes about and excavates dinosaurs, and my friends, colleagues and I love "Jurassic Park." Well, the first of the "Jurassic Park "movies, anyway. So when the announcement came that a fourth movie was due to appear in 2015, our interest was sparked, and expectations were high. Surely, we thought, this movie -- "Jurassic World" -- would be the "Avatar" of dinosaur movies: a vibrant, spectacular take on dinosaurs as we understand them today, a move away from the mostly brown, wholly scaly dinosaurs of 1993's "Jurassic Park." You know: a reboot. After all, the early 21st century is the age of fuzzy-coated tyrannosaurs, a time where we have seen a seemingly endless stream of discoveries about feathery little bird-like dinosaurs. We now know that pterosaurs had furry pelts, we've discovered iridescence on dinosaur feathers. We've also found out about bizarre dinosaurs that bristled with spines, fuzz and filaments, and a myriad other extravagant ancient beasts never dreamed of 20 years ago, like the "Hellboy" dinosaur Regaliceratops. So showing new-look dinosaurs would have been wholly consistent with the rest of the "Jurassic Park" franchise. Indeed, we're told in Michael Crichton's "Jurassic Park," the book the movie was based on, that the animals are released in upgraded batches, improved over time as more genetic data is discovered. There's a nod to this in the third movie -- 2001's Jurassic Park III -- with the "raptors" there having quills, a specific reference to advancing knowledge of real-world dinosaurs. And given the disasters associated in the movies with InGen's projects prior to the time of "Jurassic World," it would make sense to use updated, new-look animals less like the chimaeras of previous outings. But for all our anticipation, our hopes came crashing down with the tweeting of two words from "Jurassic World" director Colin Trevorrow: "no feathers." Rather than feature new-look dinosaurs and present audiences with something wonderful, "Jurassic World" appeared to have made the "bold" decision to stick with the dinosaurs of yore. Never mind all those fossils that demonstrate the presence of feathering in all bird-like dinosaurs, or the bony feather attachment knobs present on the arm of Velociraptor. Judging from the trailers, "Jurassic World" has opted to stick with scaly-skinned raptors, scientific advancement be damned. And the raptors aren't the only animals in the film to be weirdly anachronistic -- "Jurassic World's" pterosaurs are not the attractive, furry beasts they should be, but shiny-skinned horrors with grotesque, gnarly faces. The herbivores Stegosaurus and Triceratops, meanwhile, seem to be depicted with tails that droop or even drag on the ground. And the movie's super-sized mosasaur (a paddle-limbed, sea-going lizard, not a dinosaur) is not the sleek, shark-tailed reptile of 21st century understanding, but a lumpy-skinned behemoth with a frill running down its back. Even the movie's big new reveal -- a genetic mash-up called Indominus rex -- appears from early glimpses to be a chunky, fat-headed beast that looks as if it was plucked from the pages of a book published three decades ago. Everything, it seems, is decidedly old school. And to those of us that are particularly interested in these animals (and involved in outreach and public education too), it's a huge leap backwards and a bitter disappointment. Yes, yes, we know that it's just a movie. We know it's not a documentary, and that it exists to entertain. And we completely get that the world has bigger problems to worry about. But the reason this irks so much is that the "Jurassic Park" franchise has a gargantuan influence on the public's perception of ancient animals. Indeed, "Jurassic Park" did more to update public understanding of dinosaurs than any other single event. Maybe that's why "Jurassic World" can only be regarded as a disappointment. Previous installments in the franchise went to some trouble to get things right, with the look of the animals being guided by consultants. So why does "Jurassic World" seem determined to disregard this record? Why ignore the progress of knowledge and stick to safe and boring? Some have suggested that it's a practical choice, that fuzz or feathering are too difficult or expensive to render. But other movies have depicted fuzzy or feathery skin just fine -- just look at the latest "Planet of the Apes" film. And the continuity argument? Well, as I said, an in-universe feature of the franchise concerns the continual tweaking of dinosaur genomes. Furthermore, "Jurassic World" even describes how the dinosaurs now have their DNA repaired with data from birds (you know, those feathery animals), not with that of frogs as described in the first film. So, the only explanation for the retro look could be that the animals have been genetically designed to look like old-school reconstructions. So yes, "Jurassic World" is just a movie. And it may get plenty of other things right. But this reboot was also an incredible chance to do something special -- to bring new-look dinosaurs, pterosaurs and mosasaurs to modern audiences. And that chance looks like it might have been lost. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.  </corpo>

            <descricao>It wasn't the gaudy colors of Times Square that attracted photographer Franck Bohbot to New York City. It was the quiet street corners and lonely marquees.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)If Paris is the City of Light, then New York is the city of lights. In the Big Apple, they come in all sizes and all colors: HIDs and LEDs, Landlord's Haloes and expansive spotlights. They outline the Empire State Building and permeate Times Square. New York may have competition -- Tokyo and Las Vegas have their own parades of illumination -- but "the city that never sleeps" is in a league of its own when it comes to keeping you awake. Photographer Franck Bohbot, a native of the Paris area, is captivated by the lights of New York. However, it wasn't the gaudy colors of Times Square that attracted the 35-year-old Brooklyn resident. It was the quiet street corners and lonely marquees of the naked city. "When I moved to New York City in 2013, I started to walk late at night," he said in an email. "I very quickly became fascinated and (determined) to create a series of pictures at night with the everyday places where the people used to go in general: restaurants, bars, theaters, peep shows, cinemas, delis, shops, clubs. "It is," he added, "the streets." His photographs have been turned into a series, "Light On," which he shot from 2013 until this year. Some of the sights are familiar. One shot features the art-deco Radio City Music Hall, which dates to 1932. Another features Harlem's Apollo Theater, which opened in 1934. They remain grand throwbacks to the city's past, though Bohbot has shot both among deserted sidewalks, giving them a slightly haunted feeling. Perhaps more intriguing, however, are the smaller establishments. A lonely cross looms over a street in Manhattan's Alphabet City neighborhood. On the opposite side of Manhattan, a liquor store advertises its wares in Tribeca. And then there's Greenwich Village's Cafe Wha?, a landmark best known for hosting Bob Dylan and the Velvet Underground in the 1960s. Today it's a thriving rock club, but through Bohbot's lens the venue -- shot amid icy sidewalks and plowed snow -- suggests the scruffy music den it once was. "I just try to have a pictorial approach and make these photos like they were from movie stills," he said. Among his references are film director Martin Scorsese and painter Edward Hopper, the latter known for such austere paintings as "Nighthawks" and "Automat." Bohbot said the emptiness in his images is deliberate. It makes the photos more dramatic, almost literally so. "I started to have photographs empty of people," he said, though in some cases figures would step into the frame. "A little bit of patience was important to control the frame and composition. Framing, waiting, contemplating and documenting, too. "I want to be at the limit of fiction and reality." There you'll find millions of stories -- one for every light in New York City. Franck Bohbot is a French photographer based in New York City. You can follow him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. </corpo>

            <descricao>Andrew Getty, grandson of oil baron J. Paul Getty, died of an intestinal hemorrhage, acute methamphetamine intoxication, among other factors, coroner says.</descricao>
            <corpo>Los Angeles (CNN)Andrew Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty and an heir to his fortune, died of an intestinal hemorrhage and acute methamphetamine intoxication, among other factors, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said Wednesday. Getty, 47, who died March 31 in his Los Angeles home, also suffered stomach ulcers and heart disease, said Lt. Fred Corral of the county medical examiner's office. The death was ruled accidental, Corral said. Getty's parents are Ann and Gordon Getty. Andrew Getty also leaves three brothers and three half-sisters. Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. One other son died in 1958 and another died in 1973. Gordon Getty, 81, has a net worth of $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. He spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984. In its list of richest American families, Forbes estimated the Gettys' net worth to be about $5 billion. Court records show Andrew Getty had recently filed to get a restraining order against an ex-girlfriend. A hearing in the case had been scheduled in early April. Where the Getty family fortune came from In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013. "A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition. "My doctors have advised that heated arguments can cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously." CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A 10-year-old who lost consciousness on a Six Flags roller coaster in Southern California has died. Jasmine Martinez was airlifted to the hospital Friday when she was found unconscious but still breathing after riding the Revolution roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. She was pronounced dead on Saturday. On Tuesday the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said Martinez died from natural causes and not from an accident on the ride. 2013: Texas roller coaster reopens after woman's death The ride, which opened in 1976 and is billed by Six Flags as "one of the most famous and iconic looping roller coasters in the world," was temporarily closed pending a review of the incident, but reopened Monday night, amusement park officials said. "There is no evidence to suggest that this was in any way ride related," Six Flags Magic Mountain said in a statement expressing condolences to the girl's family. "We do not know if there was a pre-existing condition." More than 45 million people have safely ridden the ride since it opened, Six Flags said. 2014: Six Flags roller coaster car derails in California, 4 injured CNN's Stella Chan, Cheri Mossburg and Tony Marco contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>Just picking off the leaders of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda isn't an effective strategy </descricao>
            <corpo>Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." (CNN)American counterterrorism officials have had much to celebrate in recent days: the killing of ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in Syria and the trove of "intel" that was taken from his residence by U.S. special forces; the death of the leader of al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, in a drone strike; and the possible death in Libya of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of a virulent North African jihadist group. But the leadership of these groups is generally replaceable. Consider the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS, until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006. Since then, a number of other leaders from al-Zarqawi's group have been killed, but that did not prevent from ISIS becoming ISIS -- a group that today lords over millions of people and occupies territory in Syria and Iraq that is around the size of the United Kingdom. To be sure, any counterterrorism campaign that eliminates many leaders of a group can have a real impact -- al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan is a shadow of what it once was, in part, because of a deadly campaign of CIA drone strikes that eliminated many of its leaders and middle managers. Yet, if we zoom out to the bigger picture, from Libya on the northern coast of Africa to Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the spaces in which jihadist militant groups can operate have greatly opened up as a result of the early promise of the Arab Spring turning into the grim reality of the Arab winter. The resulting chaotic conditions and weakened states have proven a boon to ISIS and to al Qaeda and its affiliates: -- In Yemen, al Qaeda has taken advantage of the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Hadi government to seize control of large swaths of southern Yemen, including the country's fifth largest city, Mukalla. -- In Libya, jihadist groups including ISIS control about a tenth of the country, according to a senior U.S. government official. -- In Syria, al-Qaeda's local affiliate, the Nusra Front, together with ISIS are now the most powerful groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and each control large sections of the country. -- In Iraq, ISIS controls the second largest city, Mosul, and much of Anbar province, which is about a third of the landmass of the country. What to do about all this is a puzzle because much of Middle East is in the grip of a regional, sectarian civil war fomented by Iran and the Gulf States and is evolving into a Rubik's Cube-like problem that has no good solution, because when you move one piece of the cube it can create both solutions and a new set of problems simultaneously. To get a sense of how complex this Rubik's Cube is: Consider that the United States is training Syrian opposition forces to fight the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad, while it is also training Iraqi forces of the Iran-backed Iraqi government to fight ISIS. The U.S. therefore is effectively supporting both sides of the wars in Syria and Iraq. Describing problems is always, of course, much easier than solving them, but here are some ideas that can help the U.S. achieve its strategic goals in the Middle East -- dismantling ISIS and al Qaeda and avoiding a long-running sectarian regional civil war: Curtail the foreign fighter flow ISIS is taking around 1,000 casualties a month in U.S.-led airstrikes, yet it's also recruiting around 1,000 "foreign fighters" from around the Muslim world every month, so the military campaign against ISIS is something of a draw. The U.S. should put pressure on Middle Eastern countries, which supply the bulk of the foreign fighters to the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts, to curtail the flow of their nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has already made some strides in that direction, but this should also be a priority for other Arab governments. Let American soldiers go forward The exact number of U.S. troops in Iraq is not the germane issue right now. It's the constrictive rules of engagement that have been imposed upon them that prevent them from getting "outside the wire" of the bases that they are assigned to. What is needed are rules of engagement that allow U.S. forward air controllers calling in precise airstrikes as well as U.S. advisers embedded with Iraqi troops on the frontlines. Not only will this help to place more accurate air strikes on ISIS positions, but also Iraqi troops with embedded Americans will have better military advice and the comfort of knowing that they will get close American air support if ISIS threatens them. Right now that isn't the case. Step up the air campaign in Syria and Iraq One of the world's experts on counterinsurgency, New America fellow David Kilcullen suggests increasing the tempo of of the air campaign. Kilcullen points out that the average rate of coalition air strikes since last August into Syria and Iraq is about 10 per day, while in the successful air campaign against the Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, it was around 250 per day, suggesting that the U.S.-led coalition can still ratchet up the pressure on ISIS significantly. Resist calls to split Iraq up into Sunnistan, Shiastan and Kurdistan Iraq is a country where many of its citizens are products of Shia-Sunni marriages and cities like Mosul and Baghdad remain mixtures of many ethnic and religious groups. Trying to separate out Iraq into sectarian and ethnic cantons will only fuel the sectarian passions in Iraq and in the region. The model to avoid, albeit on a larger scale, was the disastrous 1947 partition of India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states in which 1 million people died. If the Iran nuclear deal gets done, use it as leverage to show al-Assad the door Use the goodwill tendered by a deal with Iran to have the Iranians pressure their close ally, al-Assad, to step down, while maintaining much of his regime in place. That way the coalition of Alawites, Christians and other regime supporters will be assured that if al-Assad goes, they won't have to go down with him and will have a stake in some kind of peace deal, rather than fighting to the death. Keep pressure on the Saudis not to resume their counterproductive air campaign in Yemen That campaign had the effect of further fracturing the already-fracturing country, which has benefited al Qaeda.

            <corpo>Mary Lee has logged more than 16,000 miles in the past two years. She's been to Florida, Bermuda and Cape Cod. She's not a beach bum, though. Mary Lee is a 3,456-pound great white shark. You wouldn't want to run into her in the surf, but you can follow her on Twitter and track her movements online. She's one of five great white sharks along the East Coast of the United States that is actively "pinging" her location via satellite transmitter. An online map tracks the sharks' courses as they go, so you can see nearly real-time data. But there's no coast-is-clear guarantee for fearful late-summer swimmers. The trackers only ping when the animals surface, and sharks don't have to surface to breathe. And of course there are more than five out there. So, if the recent shark-kayaker encounter or shark sightings in Massachusetts have you worried, your best bet is to look at the stats, shark trackers say. And use common sense. "Don't go play with the seals in the water at dawn or dusk. Other than that, enjoy life, go swimming. Because if you're worried about a shark interaction, you should be scared to death to get in the car," says Chris Fischer, founder and expedition leader of Ocearch, the research and educational nonprofit that tagged and tracks Mary Lee and other sharks. In 2013, there were 72 shark attacks worldwide, according to the International Shark Attack File. Of those, 10 were fatal. There were 47 attacks in the United States in 2013, with one fatality in Hawaii. Compare that with more than 33,000 fatal vehicle crashes in the United States in 2012, the last full year for which figures are available. In the first half of 2013, more than 15,000 motor vehicle traffic fatalities are estimated, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. "If you're the kind of person who's scared of sharks and wants to know if there's one around you, there's no technology for that," says Gregory Skomal, a biologist with Massachusetts' Division of Marine Fisheries who has tagged sharks with Ocearch. Still, the GPS transmitters with wet-dry switches that are activated when the sharks surface provide a pretty interesting picture. On Ocearch's online tracker you can see each shark's tangle of pings over several years, tracing their movements over thousands of miles. Skomal has been researching sharks for more than 25 years and has teamed up with Fischer and Ocearch three times in the past few years to tag great whites along the East Coast. He's tracking Mary Lee, Lydia, Katharine, Genie and Betsy. Lydia is a real world traveler. "Lydia is an exciting shark. Lydia makes it look like Mary Lee is a real homebody," Skomal said. Lydia was tagged in March 2013 and has already logged more than 25,000 miles. Over the last six years, Skomal has tagged more than 40 great white sharks using various tracking devices. The five tagged with Ocearch provide real-time tracking, while other trackers offer data after they detach from the shark. Fischer, who is not a biologist, has led more than 20 research expeditions with scientists around the world since 2007, tagging about 80 great white sharks in total. Ocearch gathers data and tags sharks and other marine predators by taking them out of the water for about 15 minutes using a custom lift. That ability to lift sharks weighing thousands of pounds out of the water to attach tags that track their movements in real-time is what distinguishes Ocearch, Skomal says. Some of the sharks also have Twitter accounts. "Every time a shark decides to set up its own Twitter account, it's not really up to us. We don't decide that," says Fischer. It's a personality thing, he joked. Mary Lee tweets occasionally, while Katharine, who's in her late teens, is a "chatterbox" with more than 16,000 followers. The real identity of the tweeters is a mystery. "People were inspired to give these sharks voices, and we don't know who they are," Fischer said. Fischer credits the publicly shared shark tracker and the power of social media with helping to change the tone of the conversation around sharks. After all, they're king of the sea, and the marine ecosystem depends on them. One-ton shark headed to Texas coast What devoured this great white shark? </corpo>

            <cabecalho>John Dean: Decades later, the importance of Watergate - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>John Dean writes Watergate has left a deeper scar on U.S. politics than any other scandal. CNN's "The Seventies" will look back at Watergate on Thursday.</descricao>
            <corpo>John W. Dean, former counsel to the president during the Nixon White House, is the author of 14 books, most recently "The Nixon Defense: What He Knew and When He Knew It." Dean also writes a biweekly column for Verdict at Justia.com. Watch John Dean being interviewed by Wolf Blitzer in the 6 p.m. hour Wednesday and see the story of Watergate on CNN's "The Seventies" at 9 p.m. ET Thursday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Watergate was a complex and difficult story to cover from the start, first for journalists and then historians, but it is understandably considered the mother of all modern political scandals. Now, four decades later, there is no American scandal as well-documented as the some 900 days of Watergate, nor is there any scandal that has left a deeper scar on American politics. As President Richard M. Nixon's White House counsel, I was in the middle of the scandal, but my interest in it didn't end there. Over the past 40 years, I have devoted considerable time to studying much of this remarkable record as it has slowly surfaced in testimony, autobiographies, diaries, with the release of contemporaneous documents and secret tape recordings, investigative files of the FBI, the Watergate-related grand juries, a Senate Watergate committee and House impeachment committee -- not to mention extensive federal court civil and criminal records. We are a nation that easily forgets its history. But do we want to repeat the mistakes of the 1970s, particularly Watergate? That story began on June 17, 1972, with the arrest of five burglars dressed in business suits, wearing surgical gloves, their pockets stuffed with new $100 bills and carrying suitcases filled with electronic bugging equipment. It was during the middle of President Richard Nixon's campaign for re-election. When one of the five men arrested in the Democratic National Committee was identified as the director of security for the Committee to Reelect the President, suspicion immediately focused on the Nixon White House, where the President's top aides -- and my bosses -- hastily constructed a cover-up that would bring down the President when it fell apart. As it happened, I was out of the country giving a speech in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and made my first of many mistakes by coming back to Washington when I had planned to spend a few days in San Francisco on my return from this whirlwind trip. By the time I arrived in my office on Monday, June 19, 1972, and read the story in The Washington Post about the arrests, along with a statement issued by former Attorney General John Mitchell, who was the head of re-election effort, claiming that his director of security and the other four men arrested "were not operating either in our behalf or with our consent," I knew a cover-up was being launched. By the end of that day, I understood why the White House was assisting in this cover-up. I learned that essentially the same men involved with the Watergate break-in had undertaken an earlier operation for the White House by breaking into and ransacking the files of a psychiatrist treating Daniel Ellsberg, who a year earlier had leaked the so-called Pentagon Papers, a study of the origins of the war in Vietnam. President Nixon had been plagued by leaks, and when he became unhappy with the FBI's investigation of the Ellsberg leak, he had created a secret unit in the White House to investigate. While I have never found any evidence Nixon knew in advance of, or ordered, the Watergate break-in, I do know now that he had ordered an earlier break-in at the Brookings Institution, when he believed they had a copy of the Pentagon Papers. Indeed, Nixon's secret recordings of his conversations during those first few days after the arrests at the Watergate evidence his concern that he might have ordered the Watergate break-in. Today, the tapes and written documents show that had the Watergate burglars not been arrested at the Democratic headquarters the night of June 17, they would have gone on to their true mission that night, which was to break in and bug the campaign headquarters of Nixon's Democratic opponent, Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota. That mission is traceable directly to the Oval Office, for Nixon wanted "a plant" placed in McGovern's campaign -- and he was not talking about a flower. Watergate did not really end with Nixon's resignation and departure from the White House August 9, 1974. Rather, it played out for many months more in headline-grabbing events during the cover-up trial of his top aides: former chief of staff H. R. "Bob" Haldeman, former top domestic affairs adviser John D. Ehrlichman and former attorney general John N. Mitchell, who would be found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice on January 1, 1975. While these men claimed at the time they were innocent men wrongly convicted, the record now shows that each of them quietly admitted to Judge John J. Sirica that in fact they had committed the offenses a jury had found them guilty of beyond a reasonable doubt. For political reasons, some have tried to recast the story of Watergate. In openly admitting my own guilt in the cover-up, I have always believed we can only learn from the truth. I had become the person through whom my superiors -- Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell and the President -- communicated and when I realized we were obstructing justice but was unable to convince others that the only solution was to explain truthfully what had occurred, I would break rank. I was unwilling to write the bogus report about Watergate the President wanted me to write and told him everyone involved needed to resign. He fired me and accepted the resignations of the others. When the President and my former colleagues sought, as Nixon's tapes show, to make me their scapegoat, it did not work out so well -- I had the truth on my side, as the tapes proved. This segment of CNN's series on the 1970s tells this story as it happened. CNN, Playtone and HBO have not only told the story honestly, they have uncovered video footage of the events long buried in archives, bringing to life memorable moments from these historic events.

            <cabecalho>CNN Hero gets food that would be wasted to the needy - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>CNN Hero Robert Lee's nonprofit picks up fresh food that would otherwise go to waste from New York City restaurants and gets it to people in need.</descricao>
            <corpo>New York (CNN)Like many children, Robert Lee was taught never to waste food. But growing up the son of Korean immigrants who struggled to get by, he really took the idea to heart. In college, Lee joined a student group that delivered leftover dining hall food to homeless shelters. That was when he learned the magnitude of the problem. One in six Americans struggles with food insecurity. Yet in the United States, 40% of food goes to waste. "Just the sheer amount of food that's being wasted is enough to eradicate hunger," Lee said. After graduating two years ago, Lee decided to help take the concept of rescuing food off campus. Together with fellow NYU alum Louisa Chen, he co-founded Rescuing Leftover Cuisine. The nonprofit picks up fresh food that would otherwise go to waste from New York City restaurants and gets it to people in need. Seven days a week, the organization engages volunteers to pick up and deliver any amount of food, no matter how small. Lee says operating on foot makes the group highly efficient. So far, the group has rescued 100,000 pounds of food and delivered it to homeless shelters and food kitchens. Seeing the impact he was making, Lee gave up his finance job at J.P. Morgan last year to focus on his nonprofit full time. The group is partnered with more than 50 food providers throughout New York City. But it's just the beginning, Lee says. Rescuing Leftover Cuisine recently expanded to six other cities across the United States. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 I talked with Lee about his efforts and what he's learned. Below is an edited version of our conversation. CNN: In a short amount of time, your group has already made a big difference. Why do you think it works so well? Robert Lee: We don't have a minimum pound requirement because every little bit of food counts. It can help feed someone. It's also so easy for people to come on and volunteer. The volunteers are crucial to the work that we do. They can sign up on a public calendar on our website. They choose their own commitment. If they want to do weekly, monthly, it's all up to them. And each of our slots are only about 30 minutes long. So it's very easy to fit in to your busy schedule, either along the way home from work or nearby your home. We are working on an app for volunteers to sign up which will be launched this fall. We hope it will be like Uber for delivering leftover food to the homeless! We want to expand our operations so we can rescue millions of pounds of food, by bringing on more volunteers and more restaurant partners. Volunteers learn about the issues of food waste and hunger firsthand. They see how much food is being wasted; they get to actually carry that food. CNN: Has it been challenging to find restaurants to partner with? Lee: It has been surprisingly difficult. When we first started out, we got about five partners for every 100 people that we reached out to. A lot of the restaurants have never even heard of the concept of food rescue. And they thought they would be legally held liable for the food that they were donating. So I'd have to explain to them the legislation (that) basically covers and protects all food donors from legal liability, except in the case of gross negligence. But after we had more partners, we were able to basically point across the street and be like, "Hey, we work with them. This is how it works. We make it very easy for you to do this." CNN: Your group came up with an idea to help the restaurants reduce their waste. How does that work? Lee: On a monthly basis, we supply the restaurant a consolidated report that shows on every single day how much food is being donated to us. They can get a sense of how much food they're actually throwing out and also how many mouths they're able to feed instead. The first partner that we ever had realized they were throwing out $65 a day. And instead of getting their pastries from a wholesaler, they decided to make their own from scratch. So they were able to control exactly how much they were going to produce and the quality of the food they were going to produce. So the quality went up and the food waste went down. Now we only pick up from that restaurant twice a week, and there's very little food, if any at all, to be picked up. That's kind of the best-case scenario. As we tell our partners and restaurants how much excess they have, ideally they would reduce it to the most minimalist level. CNN: You are very passionate about the issue of food waste. How did your upbringing influence that? Lee: It was very difficult for my parents when they first came to the United States. Since an early age we were moving around a lot. It was difficult even to get food sometimes. Hunger is interesting because, at least from my personal perspective, it was not only physical, it was psychological. You don't know where your next meal is coming from. The first time I really realized how much food was being wasted was in elementary school. I always used to eat the school lunch. But there were so many classmates who always talked about how bad it was, and sometimes with no thought, people would just throw it out. To see all that food go to waste is just crazy, you know? Having that perspective puts an urgency to the work that we do. There is so much food being wasted, and we just wanted to make sure that it's going to the right place. Want to get involved?

            <descricao>What did Albert Einstein think about adultery, the atomic bomb and God? At an auction, bidders shelled out more than $400,000 for letters on those topics.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)What did Albert Einstein think about adultery, the atomic bomb and God? At an auction last week, bidders shelled out just over $420,000 to own a piece of the Nobel prize winner's letters tackling these topics and other questions he faced during his lifetime. Organizers said the highlight of Thursday's auction -- which included 27 letters from Einstein -- was a 1945 letter about the connection between his special relativity theory and the atomic bomb. The genius physicist sent it to his son Hans less than a month after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it sold for $62,500, according to the Profiles in History auction house in Calabasas, California. A 1939 communication from Einstein to President Franklin Roosevelt helped start the U.S. efforts to build an atomic bomb, but Einstein later said he regretted taking that step. In the letter to his son in 1945, Einstein wrote that his work and the bomb were "only very indirectly connected." "I already showed 39 years ago that pursuant to the special relativity theory, there is an equivalence between the mass and energy of a system or that both are only different manifestations of the same thing," he wrote. "I also noted that the energies released in radioactive decay are big enough to express themselves in an inaccuracy of the mass balance of radioactive reactions. That's all." The letters -- most written in German but some in English -- offer an inside look at Einstein's personal beliefs, like his thoughts about religion and the likelihood of the existence of God. In a 1945 letter to Guy H. Raner, Einstein described himself as an atheist. "From the viewpoint of a Jesuit priest I am, of course, and have always been an atheist. ... It is always misleading to use anthropomorphical concepts in dealing with these outside of the human sphere -- childish analogies," he wrote, according to the auction organizers. Four years later, he wrote to Raner again. But this time, according to auction's organizers, his views seem to have shifted. He disparaged atheism and instead declared himself agnostic. "I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one," he wrote. "I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being." While many of the letters addressed his scientific work, religion and major political events of the time, Einstein also took time to share more personal thoughts with close friends and family. In another letter to his son Hans, he promised to send math problems to solve. And in a letter to a friend, he offered words of encouragement after learning of her husband's infidelity. In total, the letters generated $420,625, the auction house said. "The auction was extremely successful," said Marc Kruskol, a spokesman for Profiles in History. "The Einstein letters sold for more than we expected."  </corpo>

            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)China's foreign ministry says it will soon complete controversial land reclamation on some islands and reefs in disputed waters in the South China Sea. However, the ministry also said in a statement released Tuesday that it planned to build facilities on the artificial islands it has created and these would perform several tasks -- including military defense. "According to the planned operation, China is about to complete the land reclamation operation at some of the Nansha islands where China has been stationed," the statement said. It did not give a time frame. China has placed artillery pieces on one of its manufactured islands, the U.S. says, and China has announced plans for two lighthouses.  Last year, China stepped up land reclamation on several reefs in contested waters close to the Spratly Islands (called Nansha by China), alarming its Asian neighbors. The United States says that China has reclaimed some 2,000 acres -- 1,500 football fields -- in the past 18 months and has called for an "immediate and lasting" halt to the island building. In May, a U.S. surveillance plane carrying a CNN crew flew over some of China's artificial islands, triggered eight warnings from the Chinese navy to back off. The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. China reiterated that its construction did not target any other countries or affect freedom of navigation by sea or air.

            <descricao>Asian-American kids, desperate to gain admission to elite colleges, are now getting coaches to teach them how to be "less Asian." </descricao>
            <corpo>Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including Public Radio International's "The Takeaway" and WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." He is the co-author of "I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action" and editor of the graphic novel anthologies "Secret Identities" and "Shattered." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Asian-American kids, desperate to gain admission to elite colleges, are now getting coaches to teach them how to be "less Asian." Put another way, these coaches are supposed to teach young Asian-Americans how to get out of the stereotypes that we know them by. You know how the caricature goes: We're STEM-brained but inarticulate. Industrious but uninspired. Capable but lacking in creativity. We're robots who can only copy and clone and grub and grind. It's a perception that's regularly used against both Asian-Americans and Asians in Asia. Just last week, Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina calling China a nation of people who can "take a test" but who are "not terribly imaginative," applying a broad-based insult to a population of over 1 billion. And yet, as much as we may publicly bristle at the notion that Asians are "boring academic robots," it's tough to cast this image off when loud segments of our community are doing their best to reinforce it. Case in point: The Asian-American groups that gathered a few weeks ago to file a complaint with the Department of Education, charging that Asians who get higher grades and better test scores are being shortchanged by admissions officers at Harvard College following the standard practice of "holistic review." Holistic review gives colleges a means to analyze qualified students — even the complainants don't suggest that candidates who make it as far as the review process are anything less than academically outstanding — to assemble incoming classes that are diverse in interest, opinion, experience and, yes, culture, race and ethnicity. The Asian-American organizations behind this complaint are, of course, laser-focused on the last of these to the exclusion of all the other factors. But in the course of slamming holistic review as part of a racially discriminatory conspiracy against Asian applicants, they're also supporting the notion that we can't compete when measured on metrics other than grades and test results. That's because these advocates have chosen to focus on SAT scores as their primary evidence that colleges do not embrace "meritocracy." But the fact is, unlike in Asian countries like China, Korea or Japan, American colleges do not use the results of a single national exam as the sole metric for college placement, and for good reason. Doing so is a recipe for cranking out students who are focused on "learning to the test" and who don't have the time or bandwidth to pursue their own personal pastimes and obsessions — the kinds of things that tend to enrich character, expand horizons and make you a more interesting person. iReport: Why I had to unlearn lessons from my Asian-American upbringing Asian parents certainly have their children's best interest at heart. But in many cases, their educational perspective has been shaped by exams and numerical placements, from growing up in societies where standardized test results and the colleges that they place you in define your entire life. It's not surprising that, for them, merit equals test results, and softer traits — like passion, imagination and originality — seem less worthy of inclusion in the process of judging an applicant's qualifications for college admission. And yet, those quirks are what catch admissions officers' eyes. When faced with a sea of applicants whose test scores are all in the 99th percentile and who have demonstrated spectacular academic success throughout their educational careers, you don't stand out by scoring 2400 instead of 2228 (the median SAT score for Harvard's entering class last year) or by having perfect grades in high school (as did 54% of Harvard freshmen). Everyone's a high achiever, but the lucky individuals admitted to the class of 2018 were the ones who had unique and compelling stories to tell. The notion that kids might thrive by being different doesn't come naturally to Asian immigrant parents, raised as they were in more rigid academic cultures. That's why a growing number are turning to consulting companies like Top Tier, Ivy Coach and ThinkTank Learning for advice on how to help their kids to look not just smart, but special, by highlighting their more idiosyncratic pursuits and interests. The cost? As much as hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It's ironic. Asian-American parents who've pushed their children to conform to two-dimensional templates are now paying big money for programs designed to release them from their tiger cages and unleash their hidden iconoclasts. Here's a thought: Why not save that money — and the outrage and effort being expended on campaigns for test-centric meritocracy — and encourage the dreams and passions of your kids instead?

            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Ten people, some with alleged ties to a radical political organization, have been arrested in Hong Kong, accused of conspiring to manufacture explosives, police in the Chinese territory say. At a news conference Monday, police said they had arrested five men and four women, ranging in age from 21 to 34, whom they described as members of a "local syndicate." A tenth person, a 58-year-old man, was arrested Monday afternoon at Lo Wu, a border crossing between Hong Kong and Mainland China. Police said their investigations showed that two men in the group were planning to test the powder of an explosive device. They raided a location in the territory's remote Sai Kung district Sunday evening, where they arrested the pair, seized chemicals and detonated explosives. Chemicals recovered during a subsequent house search were tested and found to be precursors of TATP, a highly volatile explosive thought to have been used in the 2005 London bombings and other terror attacks. Officers also found the chemical formula for manufacturing smoke grenades, police said. Police then swooped on others linked to the pair, and also seized air rifles, "V for Vendetta"-style face masks, political stickers and pamphlets, computers containing a sketch of an explosive device, and maps showing locations in Admiralty and Wan Chai -- districts where the city's government is based. Police would not say whether the maps identified targets where the explosives were intended to be used, or whether authorities were working with China's People's Liberation Army, which also has a base in Admiralty. "There are maps that show the locations of Admiralty and Wan Chai, and there are possibilities that this group of people might want to do something in this particular location," said Au Chin-chau, chief superintendent of the police Organized Crime and Triad Bureau. Police said some members of the group claimed to be members of a local radical organization. Police would not name the organization. The arrests took place in an abandoned TV studio in Sai Kung. Now derelict and covered in graffiti, the studio is a popular place for photo shoots, teenager parties and paintball-like games with airsoft guns.  News of the arrests came a day after thousands of pro-democracy protesters returned to Hong Kong streets, nine months after a demonstration that triggered 79 days of heated occupations in the semiautonomous Chinese city-state. A prominent leader of those protests, Joshua Wong, 18, said that there was a lack of evidence and that the arrests were a "farce" to smear localists, a group of hardline pro-Hong Kong, anti-Mainland demonstrators. Read more: Who is Joshua Wong? "Even if you wanted to storm the Legislative Council, you wouldn't make explosives to get in, it's not reasonable," he told CNN. He also questioned why any suspects, who have yet to be named, would readily admit they were affiliated with a local radical group. "No matter who did it, the government successfully vilifies the localists," he said, adding that he did not identify as a localist. Ronald Leung, a spokesman for a hardline localist group, repudiated the idea of making explosives. But he speculated that if police allegations were true, it could reflect the level of frustration developing for a minority in the pro-democracy camp. "It's sad, because it shows that the rule of the central and local governments has failed, and people have only become angrier," he said. "It is only inevitable that people will find more and more radical ways of resistance." Political tension has ramped up in recent days as Hong Kong's government prepares to table a Beijing-backed reform package ahead of Hong Kong's 2017 elections. The proposal, if approved, would allow Hong Kongers to cast votes for their next leader -- if the candidates are first vetted by China. But pro-democracy legislators, who have just enough votes to veto the bill, have sworn to do just that. Wong told CNN on Monday that the chance of it passing was "zero." CNN's Ivan Watson, Bex Wright, Vivian Kam and Agnes Chan contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho> A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's no accident that the first P8s were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and here it's watching China.</descricao>
            <corpo>Above the South China Sea (CNN)Take-off is swift on the U.S. Navy's P8-A Poseidon -- there's no slow roll down the runway on military flights -- and within minutes, the turquoise blue of the South China Sea comes into view from the window of America's most advanced surveillance and sub-hunting aircraft. The P8 crew, composed of more than a dozen naval aviators, invited me into the cockpit to watch and to listen. CNN last week first reported on this secret surveillance mission, which eight times received warnings from the Chinese navy to leave the contested area. This is a behind-the-scenes look at the journey. Approaching the P8-A Poseidon on the tarmac, it's easy to mistake the sophisticated aircraft for one of the many other Boeing 737 planes around it. The P8 is based on a 737 frame, but the similarities end there. Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Peeking out of the fuselage are numerous antennas, domes and camera wells, plus a bomb bay for sub-hunting torpedoes and spaces under the wings for Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Inside, the jet is home to an array of advanced intelligence-gathering equipment. I have the feeling of entering a CIA listening station in the sky. It's no accident that the first P8s -- only 18 months old -- were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and its principle mission here is keeping a watchful eye on China. Once we're aboard, we sit in on the flight crew's "delta briefing," the final briefing before takeoff. The aircraft's commander, Lt. Cmdr. Matt Simpson, lays out the mission plan. The P8 will leave from Clark Air Base in the Philippines and fly some 460 miles west to three reefs -- Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief -- which Beijing has rapidly been transforming into expansive islands and, the U.S. fears, soon-to-be permanent military stations 600 miles from China's coastline. From the air, the waters appear quiet and peaceful, but 60% of world trade traffics through here. And underneath the sea floor are believed to be enormous deposits of oil and gas. That helps explain the international free-for-all underway to claim an array of barely visible reefs and shoals. It's not only China but also the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei that are involved. Though the coastlines of the other countries are all closer than China's, they are still more than 200 miles away, far from their territorial waters, which by international law extend only 12 miles out from shore. America's own coastline is, of course, thousands of miles away, but the U.S. is still very much in the mix. It's the defender, in effect, of free passage through international waters for all international cargo ships and, crucially, the U.S. Navy. Forty-five minutes into the flight, the first mission target comes into view: Subi Reef. More than two dozen Chinese dredgers fill the lagoon, pumping sand from the ocean floor in huge plumes onto the surface, slowly and gradually building up an island from scratch. The scale and pace of their work is mesmerizing. In two years, China has expanded the surface area of reefs it claims in the South China Sea from just five acres to more than 2,000. The P8 crew expect the Chinese navy to warn them away as we approach. Usually these "challenges," as they refer to them, come once the jet is within a few miles, and indeed, the radio soon relays a voice speaking in Chinese-accented English: "This is the Chinese navy. This is the Chinese navy ... Please leave immediately to avoid misunderstanding." From both sides, the communication is calm and, mostly, professional. The American pilot quickly responds from a well-rehearsed script explaining that this is a U.S. aircraft operating in international airspace over international waters. U.S. threatens peace in South China Sea, Beijing says Still, as the Chinese navy radio operators come back on the line to repeat their warning, I can hear frustration building in their voices. In one case, the operator's voice grows louder and louder, ending in a high-pitched "You go!" The Chinese give warnings like this eight times during the flight. It turns out there are also civilian aircraft in the vicinity. A Delta Air Lines flight on that same frequency hears the Chinese challenge, and then pipes into the frequency to ask what's going on. The Chinese navy radio operator identifies himself, possibly to reassure them. The flight crew notes that this can be a very nerve-racking experience for civilian aircraft in the area. For now, these Chinese challenges are surface-to-air, coming from new early-warning radar stations they have positioned on the islands or from Chinese navy ships patrolling them. These reefs are too far from air bases in China for Chinese aircraft to intercept the P8 and start a potential confrontation in the air, but that may change if and when these islands have working airstrips. Fact is, China is already on its way. As we leave Subi Reef, we approach Fiery Cross Reef a few minutes travel away. Here China has made the most extensive progress. What used to be a rocky reef barely visible above the waves is now equipped with a nearly completed runway, a tower, an early warning radar station and barracks for Chinese soldiers and sailors. Meanwhile, Chinese dredgers continue to dig away at a deep-water harbor for Chinese ships. This is what some call China's "unsinkable aircraft carrier." If China continues to militarize the islands, as the U.S. fears, the three reefs will form strategic Chinese military bases right in the middle of some of the most contested waters in the world. On board the P8, the mood is calm and confident. These crews have been flying these flights for months now. But the more China builds, the U.S. sailors tell me, the more aggressively the Chinese navy is challenging them. CNN has learned that the U.S. is considering flying its aircraft -- and sailing its Navy warships -- even closer to the islands to further demonstrate that the U.S. does not recognize China's claims. The lowest we fly on this mission is 15,000 feet. But that could soon change. And what happens if China starts deploying its aircraft to these waters? The airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef is already long enough to accommodate every military aircraft in the Chinese arsenal. P8 flights hundreds of miles closer to the mainland are already intercepted by Chinese fighters. Last fall, in one such encounter, the Chinese pilot came dangerously close. The prospect of U.S.-Chinese collisions in the air are truly alarming, as past events have demonstrated. In 2001, a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. EP-3, the P8's predecessor, over Hainan Island, right off the Chinese mainland, leading to a major crisis as the damaged U.S. plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The P8 flight crew speaks confidently and calmly about their mission. But they know they are in the midst of a major and contentious potential conflict. Chinese protests are becoming more stern. U.S. surveillance flights and naval patrols are becoming more aggressive. And the two countries' positions are, for now, irreconcilable. China views these islands as its sovereign territory and describes its commitment to them as "unshakable." The U.S. views the area as international waters and airspace. Aboard the P8, it is difficult to see how those differences are resolved.  </corpo>

            <corpo>This story complements the Culinary Journeys TV series, airing monthly on CNN International. See more of the show at cnn.com/journeys. Share photos of your own Culinary Journeys on Instagram with the hashtag #CNNFood for a chance to be featured on CNN. (CNN)A bowl of juicy roast pork noodles? Liked. A plate of crispy French fries accompanying a perfect piece of steak? Liked. A warm molten lava cake paired with vanilla bean ice cream? Liked and, if the comments are to be believed, actively drooled over. In a foodstagram-obsessed city like Hong Kong, scrolling through other people's social media dinner photos is a popular pastime. So no surprise that some so-called food bloggers have achieved almost superstar status. We challenged five of the top Hong Kong-based gastronauts to name their all-time favorite restaurant in a city with thousands of them.  "Asking a food lover what their favorite restaurant is, is like asking a father which of his children he likes best," says e-ting's Janice Leung, a writer and editor specializing in travel, lifestyle, culture and, obviously, food. Her top selection for Hong Kong is Seventh Son in Wan Chai, which she argues serves the best Cantonese food on the planet. "The food served is a great example of Cantonese culinary traditions, be it meticulously made dim sum, or some of the best roast suckling pig money can buy." Seventh Son, 4/F to 6/F, Kwan Chart Tower, 6 Tonnochy Road, Wan Chai; +852 2892 2888; lunch 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m., dinner 6-11 p.m.  Michelle Ng is the mastermind behind the food blog Chopstixfix. She claims she's loved food since before she can recall. "I struggle to nominate a favorite restaurant in Hong Kong as there are too many I truly enjoy going to, but one place that I have a real soft spot for is Yu Chuan in Wan Chai," says Ng. "The quality and execution of the food is excellent and the cost is wallet-friendly. "I love a lot of their dishes but my all-time favorite is the Ma Po Tofu." Yu Chuan, Shop B, 1/F, Hundred City Center, 7-17 Amoy St., Wan Chai; +852 2838 1561; open daily 6-11 p.m.  Hong Kong based communications consultant and food writer Chris Dwyer also admits zeroing in on a single eatery is difficult. "In a city with 40,000 places to eat, choosing a favorite is agonizing and almost impossible." When forced at knife and fork point, he goes for Caprice at the Four Seasons. Why? "The harbor views, calm decadence and understated but faultless service help, but most of all it's the brilliant French cuisine." "Chef de cuisine Fabrice Vulin isn't afraid to weave in global flavors and ingredients, creating stellar dishes such as the outrageously good pork belly with black truffle." Caprice at Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, 8 Finance St., Central; +852 3196 8888; open daily noon-11:30 p.m.  Nicole Fung runs That Food Cray, a global gastronomic, travel and lifestyle online media platform -- which is a fancy way to say she runs a food blog. The writer's all-time favorite is nothing fancy though. Shun Hing Long Gwai Kee Soya Product Factory in Cheung Sha Wan is an unassuming old school soybean product shop. "This place reminds me of my grandparents. "I don't have many memories of my grandparents, but I do remember them taking me for tofu pudding every time we visited Hong Kong at this little tiny tofu shop," says Fung. "Every time I'm in the neighborhood, I reminisce with a bowl of tofu pudding with soy milk and a plate of griddle fried tofu with fish paste." Shun Hing Long Gwai Kee Soya Product Factory, 451 Shung Ning Road, Cheung Sha Wan; +852 2386 7743; open daily 7 a.m.-7 p.m.  The Dimsum Diaries is a food blog run by Alejandra Wilkinson, who started writing food reviews as a tribute to her love for food. "One of my favorite places to eat in Hong Kong has got to be Le Bistro Winebeast," says Wilkinson. The food at this Wan Chai restaurant is completely faultless and the service excellent, she says. The cozy atmosphere "makes you feel like you could actually be in a little bistro in Paris." Aside from the best steak tartare she's ever had, Wilkinson raves about its well-priced and fantastic wine. Le Bistro Winebeast, 15 McGregor St., Wan Chai; +852 2479 6833; open Tuesday-Sunday, noon-3 p.m., 6-11 p.m.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>How China's 'Great Cannon' works - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Nicholas Weaver: Researchers explain how China's "Great Cannon" is said to attack website targets. He says the implications are dangerous. </descricao>
            <corpo>Nicholas Weaver is a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley University. He was one of the lead authors of a report on China's "Great Cannon," which was released by The Citizen Lab in April. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's own. China hasn't directly addressed claims about the existence of the Great Cannon, but says it's interested in working with the international community to keep "cyberspace peaceful, secure, open and cooperative." (CNN)Readers may have heard of the "Great Firewall," the powerful filters that the People's Republic of China uses to prevent Chinese citizens from accessing the whole Internet. The Great Firewall monitors traffic entering and exiting China, and then disrupts prohibited content and connections. Imagine an eavesdropper on a party line: when one party says something objectionable, the eavesdropper shouts into the line until everyone hangs up. While very effective, the Firewall is not an offensive weapon. The device we dubbed the "Great Cannon" is different; it acts as a "man-in-the-middle," able to not just shout down a conversation but actually able to change content as it passes through the Internet. Unlike the Great Firewall, whoever designed the Great Cannon created a deliberately offensive tool, designed to selectively replace benign web content with malicious content. The only known use of the Great Cannon was to further Chinese censorship. Study: China cybercensors attack outside its borders with 'Great Cannon' The organization GreatFire seeks to monitor and circumvent Chinese censorship. One technique it's developed has been dubbed "Collateral Freedom" -- hosting content on encrypted services that it believes are "too important to block."  During March and April, when a non-Chinese web surfer visited a page containing unencrypted content served by Chinese search engine Baidu, the Great Cannon would occasionally replace that content with a series of instructions for the web surfer's browser. These instructions caused the browser to repeatedly fetch content from "Collateral Freedom" pages, executing a "denial of service" (DOS) attack. It would be like an attacker telling tens of thousands of cellphones to all dial the same number at the same time. The first round of attacks, between March 16 and March 26, directly targeted GreatFire's Amazon CloudFront instances in an attempt to either cause Amazon to remove these instances or simply run up GreatFire's hosting costs. Although this significantly affected GreatFire's bill, it failed to block the services and GreatFire responded with some technical changes to mitigate the attack. But GreatFire's CloudFront domains aren't memorable, so those in China who wish to discover one need another source. GreatFire uses Github for this, hosting both instructions for evading the Great Firewall and directions on obtaining a copy of the Chinese language New York Times. Previously, China tried blocking GitHub but quickly relented when local developers objected. So the Great Cannon's operator switched the target, instructing newly hijacked web browsers to repeatedly contact GitHub. This attack persisted until April 7, although GitHub was able to mitigate this attack after the first few days. Since then, the Great Cannon has gone silent; we have not detected any further attempts to use this device. While it still ran, we were able to isolate the Cannon's location, showing that it wasn't a group of hacker vigilantes but a dedicated tool that shares code and network location with the Great Firewall.  We don't expect that hackers would have access to the Great Firewall's source code or be able to install devices in the backbone of the Chinese Internet across multiple Internet providers. Combined with the choice of targets, the Great Cannon is almost certainly a tool of the Chinese government. Though the Great Cannon has gone silent, the dangerous implications remain. To start with, China seemed willing to explicitly attack a U.S. company, GitHub, in an attempt to suppress online content that the Chinese government finds objectionable. It would also be a trivial change for the Great Cannon's operator to turn the Cannon into a direct exploitation tool, targeting web servers directly. Instead of replacing content with the instructions to execute a DOS attack, the replaced content instead could exploit the target's browser to take over the target's computer. Combined with some target awareness and a minor change to the Cannon itself, the Chinese could use this to hack any web browser -- if the Chinese can identify their target's IP address and the target happens to fetch unencrypted content hosted from within China. The Great Cannon was also a direct attack on Baidu. For everyone outside of China, any page containing an unencrypted Baidu service, even something as innocuous as an advertisement, now may be a vehicle for a Chinese government attack. And although the Cannon primarily replaced content served by Baidu, it can just as easily target any other Chinese service. Anyone concerned with the possibility of Chinese government hacking now needs to consider the entire Chinese Internet as explicitly hostile. How can Chinese Internet companies hope to compete?  Although China's use of the Great Cannon to censor content is objectionable, if China instead chooses to use this to directly exploit computers, they would have company. According to recent revelations, the NSA in the United States and the GCHQ in the United Kingdom have developed and deployed an attack using similar techniques that they have used against Belgacom, Belgium's primary telecommunications provider. The Internet is now a hostile place. If an adversary sees your unencrypted traffic, it is not just a data leak but an attack vector they can use to exploit your computer. Encryption isn't just a matter of privacy but a necessity for self-defense.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>China: Admiral Sun Jianguo defends artificial islands - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>China defends building artificial islands in the South China Sea, saying land reclamation in contested waters is "justified, legitimate and reasonable."</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)China has defended building artificial islands in contested waters in the South China Sea, saying the land reclamation is "justified, legitimate and reasonable." Adm. Sun Jianguo told a regional defense forum in Singapore Sunday that the construction did not target any other countries or affect the freedom of navigation, according to comments carried by state broadcaster CCTV. "I want to reaffirm that this construction is well within the scope of China's sovereignty and it is justified, legitimate and reasonable," said Sun, the deputy chief of General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army. "In spite of the sufficient historical and legal evidence and its indisputable claims of rights and interests, China has exercised enormous restraint, making positive contributions to peace and stability of the region and the world at large," he added. Sun's comments came a day after U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter singled out China as a source of instability in the region and called for "an immediate and lasting halt" to island building. "The United States is deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states," Carter said at the annual meeting, which is known as the Shangri-La Dialogue.  Anger has simmered over the South China Sea among China and neighboring countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which have argued about existing territorial claims and the natural resources that lie beneath them. Last month, a U.S. surveillance plane carrying a CNN crew flew over such artificial islands, triggered eight warnings from the Chinese navy to back off. U.S. officials are concerned about China's militarization of some of the islands and are trying to create public awareness of it, but Chinese media slammed the issue as being manufactured and "sensationalized on purpose" by the West. While other countries have also reclaimed land in the disputed waters, Carter said that China had "gone much further and faster" -- reclaiming more than 2,000 acres in the past 18 months. And China has placed artillery pieces on one of its manufactured islands, a U.S. official said Friday. Responding to audience questions at the forum, Sun said that no decision had been reached on whether China would set up an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea, and such a move would depend on whether "China's air and maritime security" is threatened. In 2013, China declared an air defense zone in the East China Sea that covered islands disputed by China and Japan, eliciting strong criticisms from Japan and its close ally the U.S. However, Sun also sought to play down the tensions, stressing that China was committed to resolving the South China Sea dispute peacefully.

            <cabecalho>Beijing rolls out China's toughest smoking ban - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A tough new ban on smoking indoors rolls out across the China's capital, with lighting up now prohibited in all offices, restaurants, bars and airports. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A tough new ban on smoking indoors rolls out across the Chinese capital Monday, with lighting up now prohibited in all offices, shopping malls, restaurants, bars and airports. Many outdoor public places such as the areas outside kindergartens and hospitals will also be required to be smoke-free. Businesses and institutions that flout the law will face fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600) and repeat offenders could have their licenses revoked. Bernhard Schwartländer, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Beijing, says it's a "major advance" in tobacco control in China, where more cigarettes are smoked than anywhere else in the world. Here's five things to know as China battles its "smoking dragon."  It's not the first time Beijing has tried to tackle its smoking problem -- a previous ban launched in 2008 was widely ignored. After closing them with great fanfare, the airport quietly reopened the smoking rooms in its terminals. However, unlike previous efforts, this law has teeth -- flouters will face stringent fines. Individuals must pay 200 yuan ($32) (up from 10 yuan ($1.60)) and businesses risk a penalty of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600). Anyone who breaks the law three times will find themselves named and shamed on a government website. Schwartländer at the WHO says effective enforcement in a city the size of Beijing will be a "colossal task" but the law "deserves to be regarded as a major step forward in the battle against the smoking dragon."  China is home to some 300 million smokers and some four million live in Beijing. More than one in every three cigarettes in the world is smoked in China. And those cigarettes are cheap -- as little as $1.50 for a popular brand like Zhongnanhai. According to the Tobacco Atlas, 26% of the price of a packet of cigarettes is tax, compared with a WHO benchmark of 75%. The China National Tobacco Corp makes one third of the world's cigarettes and is a state-run monopoly responsible for 3.6 million farmers, four million tobacco retailers and half a million related employees. Health authorities have, until now perhaps, been reluctant to take on the interests of a giant industry.  Northern China's smog-ridden skies have been linked to 1.2 million premature deaths a year but smoking is arguably a far more pressing health problem. According to the WHO, the city's concentration of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers -- known as PM2.5 -- can often reach 500 or more. While this dwarfs the WHO's recommended exposure of below 25 -- the smoke from just three cigarettes burning in a restaurant can result in a level of 600. "The smoke from 20 or more smokers, which is not unfeasible in a crowded bar or restaurant, will result in a PM2.5 level that will be off the chart," says Schwartländer, writing in The Lancet.  Smoking is a handy icebreaker in China, a way to greet someone and few interactions aren't made easier by offering a cigarette. Until an edict by President Xi Jinping in 2013, it was common for government officials to have a cigarette in hand while performing their public duties. Chairman Mao Zedong and paramount leader Deng Xiaoping were renowned smokers. While the new ban will limit tobacco advertising, it might already be too late for the next generation. In 2013, a WHO survey found that among five to six year old children, almost nine in 10 can recognize at least one brand of cigarettes and one in five expect to be smokers when they grow up.  Some 45% of men smoke daily, according to 2013 figures, compared with just 2.1% of women -- this means that Chinese women endure some of the highest rates of exposure to second hand smoke in the world. It's hoped that this army of female non-smokers might prove to be a secret weapon in enforcing the new ban. At an event in Beijing on Sunday, groups of school girls and older women danced outside the "Bird's Nest" Olympic stadium, which was draped in anti-smoking banners. But new data shows that while the overall smoking rate has declined in the past decade, there has been a "significant increase" in women lighting up.  </corpo>

            <descricao>The standoff between the U.S. and China over disputed territory in the South China Sea is escalating into a war of words and military maneuvers in the area.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)China has placed artillery pieces on one of the islands it is manufacturing in contested waters in the South China Sea, a U.S. official told CNN Friday. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The official added that the artillery pieces are no longer visible -- having either been removed or concealed -- following a U.S. Navy P8-A Poseidon surveillance mission over the area. CNN was on board the flight, which took place last week. READ: Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Amidst the Chinese military buildup, Washington and Beijing are engaging in a war of words over the disputed South China Sea territory, with pledges of military maneuvers in the area. "China urges the U.S., think three times before taking action; act responsibly; stop all provocative speech and acts; and do more things that will benefit the region's peace and stability instead of the opposite," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Thursday. The comments came after U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter began an important trip to the Pacific region, during which he vowed that the U.S. would not back down on its military operations around islands China is manufacturing in disputed waters 600 miles from its coastline "There should be no mistake: The United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as we do all around the world," Carter said Wednesday. In response, China's foreign ministry demanded the U.S. use caution. "What kind of function can the U.S. have for the region's peace and prosperity?" the foreign ministry spokesman asked. "Fundamentally speaking, would creating a mess in the Asia Pacific, which is the core engine of the world economy, fit the U.S. interests?" READ: Behind the scenes: A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup Last week, the Chinese Navy repeatedly issued warnings during the P8's mission. The crew answered each radio challenge with the same response: that the U.S. was flying in international airspace over international waters. In his comments at a change of command ceremony in Hawaii for U.S. military forces in the Pacific, Carter said it is not only the U.S. that supports a continued American military presence in the region, but also nervous Southeast Asian nations, some of whom, including Vietnam and close U.S. ally the Philippines, have competing claims for islands and reefs in the South China Sea. "China's actions are bringing countries in the region together in new ways," Carter said. "And they're increasing demand for American engagement in the Asia-Pacific. We're going to meet it. We will remain the principal security power in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The women's national team is the toast of China after recording the country's first World Cup victory since 2007. Wang Lisi's 91st-minute winner was enough for her side to scrape past the Netherlands Thursday in a match it dominated from start to finish. China has enjoyed relative success since the inception of the Women's World Cup in 1991, reaching the quarterfinals on three occasions -- two of those coming when it hosted the tournament in 1991 and 2007. Its best ever finish was a runner-up spot in the 1999 edition of the competition when it lost out on penalties to the United States. This is in stark contrast to the men's national team, which has qualified for just one World Cup -- in 2002 -- and lost all three games that year without scoring a goal. The women's team suffered an opening-day defeat at the hands of host Canada last week and exacted redemption of sorts with its own injury-time winner against the Netherlands. The victory leaves China tied on three points with Thursday's opponent -- one behind group leader Canada, who played out a storm-interrupted goalless draw with New Zealand later that night. "We created lots of scoring opportunities," China coach Hao Wei told FIFA's official website. "Our players were under a lot of pressure after losing the first match. Today they showcased their true abilities and I am so proud of them. "We should have scored more, although this team is very young and lacks international experience. However, they executed the game plan well and I'm delighted with their performance."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>China: Brave new world for spy thrillers? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>China, a land of surveillance and increasing military might, is turning into a writer's paradise for those with a thriller to tell. </descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)China, a land of surveillance and increasing military might, is turning into a writer's paradise for those with a thriller to tell. Western authors say its rise has been pure gold for suspense novels, filling a gaping hole left by the end of the Cold War. China has its own pack of spy novelists too. "The mysterious side of China certainly lends itself to thriller writing," says novelist Adam Brookes. The second installment of his critically acclaimed Night Heron trilogy, a spy yarn set between China and the UK, will debut this month. "Consider: China has emerged as a global power, yet we do not know how Xi Jinping engineered his rise to the leadership. We barely understand the country's core mechanisms!" he says. "So we spy, to find out. And suddenly you have all sorts of dramatic possibilities." In August, Mai Jia, nicknamed China's John le Carré, sees the UK publication of "In the Dark" -- his follow up to his codebreaking and counterespionage novel "Decoded." These are just the latest developments in a wider publishing tale: a growing interest in Asia, and in particular China, as a setting for tales of intrigue.  After the Cold War, writers spent years mourning the loss of old enemies and looking for new ones. They flirted with corporations and took on the Middle East. Yet they struggled to find something that really stuck. "It was easy for le Carré and people like that -- they had Russia. They were the obvious enemy," says Paul French, author of murder mystery "Midnight in Peking." Enter China, a former Cold War foe, which remains Communist by name and secretive by nature and it's no surprise that a growing number of acclaimed spy writers are traveling east in search of inspiration. Charles McCarry, one of the U.S.' most respected writers of spy fiction chose China for his 2013 hit: "The Shanghai Factor." It follows a young U.S. agent and his relationship with a mysterious woman named Mei, who is supposedly working for Chinese intelligence. The novel works both as light entertainment and as a more serious metaphor of the increasingly complicated relationship between China and the U.S.  For some, China's characteristic imperviousness is a major obstacle. Can foreign writers get the level of access needed for a great spy novel? "They won't even let foreigners into the Beijing naval museum without a Chinese ID card!" says French. For others, its impenetrable nature is a playground. U.S. journalist Alex Berenson, who set his second spy novel "The Ghost War" on a conflict between the US and China, admitted he left China without a deep understanding of Chinese Communist Party protocol. "Those doors stayed closed to me, as they do to nearly all Westerners," he wrote in the New York Times. "But the opacity that maddens the reporters is manna for novelists, and the novelist in me had a fine time imagining what might be happening behind closed doors in Beijing." China's weird and widely popular workplace novels  Contemporary Chinese writers are catching on too. For Charlotte Middlehurst, books editor at Time Out China, this represents a significant departure from the past. While thrillers, in particular detective stories, have long been popular in China (Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes are big hits), Chinese writers have penned few themselves. "Up until recently the number of foreigners writing spy thrillers set in China has far outweighed that of local writers," Middlehurst says. Not anymore. China now has its own pack-- Xiaolong Qui and He Jiahong for example. "They, along with other writers, most notably Mai Jia, have taken the thriller genre and added Chinese characteristics turning it into something altogether more unique." Middlehurst attributes the trend partly to the rise of social media, which has facilitated online fanzines and reader communities. She also believes President Xi's recent crackdown on corruption "has resonated deeply with readers and authors" as previously off bound topics have become more openly talked about. READ: Profiting from China's banned books  Not all are convinced that China will become literary villain number one though. Spy fiction in the UK and U.S. at least is still dominated by tried-and-tested tropes. Readers like established archetypes. And foreign language books generally struggle to reach these audiences, not least books from or set in China. The culture remains confusing, the history unexplored and the language totally baffling. "When the landscape is so unfamiliar, many readers are wary of plunging into it," says Brookes. "I have tried with "Night Heron" to walk the commercial fiction reader into China and keep them oriented, but it's a hard trick to pull off." "And I think many thriller writers will see renewed strategic rivalries with Russia, the threat of global jihadism and terrorism as more accessible sources of locale and plot," he says. Despite this Brookes is optimistic. "China is the great strategic story of our time, and everybody should be making some effort to get to grips with it," he says. If China doesn't yet have a license to thrill, it's only a matter of time.

            <cabecalho>China to its drivers: Rein in your road rage - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>New drivers in China must take a course in being "safe and civilized" as authorities attempt to address a rise in road rage.</descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)On the sprawling ground of Beijing Gongjiao Driving School, hundreds of white Volkswagen sedans crawled at a snail's pace as students behind the wheels practiced starting, turning and parking their cars one recent afternoon. "When students become impatient because of the long queue, I tell them to consider this a preview of Beijing's traffic jams," said Geng Guizhi, a veteran instructor at the school, where as many as 10,000 people sign up in a single month. "I tell them, you have to remain calm and patient." That message is more relevant and important than ever, as roads in major Chinese cities become increasingly congested, creating a lot of frustration and anger -- as well as grave danger -- on the streets. Thanks to continued rapid economic growth, government statistics show a 20% jump in private car ownership in 2014 -- to 105 million cars nationwide. The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 200,000 people die on the roads of China every year. From the beginning of 2012 to the end of April this year, police linked 104 million traffic violations to some form of road rage, ranging from forcibly changing lanes or overtaking other vehicles, to failing to yield.  The past few weeks, state media have reported several egregious examples of road rage across China. In early May, a BMW car driven by a young woman collided with a bus in the eastern city of Xuzhou when she tried to change lane. During an ensuing argument, the woman asked two male friends to assault the bus driver -- and then verbally abused traffic policemen upon their arrival. During the same week, a Mercedes-Benz car driver ran over and killed an elderly man in the southwestern city of Kunming, after the driver tried to cut in line at a toll booth and got into an argument with the victim's family. One of the most disturbing incidents was caught on camera on May 3, as a high-speed chase between two cars in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu only ended when the male driver forced the female driver ahead of him to stop under an elevated highway. What happened next shocked and outraged the nation: He dragged her out of the car, threw her to the ground and viciously beat her -- showing no mercy even when she tried to escape.  Public opinion shifted, however, when dashcam footage from the male driver's car emerged. That video, taken before the incident, showed the female driver cutting in front of him at the last second to take a nearly missed highway exit. Many of the woman's sympathizers online turned against her, stirring a national debate on drivers behaving badly and road rage -- with thousands of comments calling reckless driving as appalling as wanton violence. The female driver, who suffered concussion and fractures, has since apologized in an open letter, while the male driver remains behind bars pending a police investigation. "No matter what she did, he should have never resorted to violence," said Liang Di, 28, an office worker in Beijing taking her first driving lesson at the Gongjiao School. "But I also feel the woman driver wasn't blameless -- everything has two sides."  Under the watchful eyes of her instructor, Liang meticulously practiced the steps of starting a manual-shift car. Like the nearly 28 million people who received a new driver's license last year, she also had to sit through a class on how to become a "safe and civilized driver." The class and a mandatory test on the subject are all part of the government's effort to nip the problems of bad drivers and road rage in the bud, as the authorities tighten traffic rules and increase penalties for violators. "Offensive driving caused by road rage is a severe violation of law that disrupts traffic order and endangers safety," said the Ministry of Public Security in a statement after the Chengdu incident. "Drivers should consciously overcome their road rage." Traffic police departments in cities like Beijing even produce nightly television shows that air on local channels, highlighting the potentially deadly consequences of road rage through footage of horrific accidents. Just outside the orderly "streets" of the Beijing driving school one recent evening, the authorities' message appeared to have fallen on deaf ears in the real world as motorists, cyclists and pedestrians fought for space, amid the constant sound of honking and braking. For now, the law of the jungle -- anything goes -- still seems to rule the streets of China, with millions of new cars and news drivers hitting the road every year that may add to the chaos, anger and danger.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Every year, Hong Kong holds the world's largest mass gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But this year will be different.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Tens of thousands of people dressed in black. A sea of candlelight. The roar of pro-democracy anthems sung in Chinese. Every year, Hong Kong holds the world's largest annual mass gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But after sprawling pro-democracy protests put the city at bitter odds with China last fall, this year's anniversary takes on a different meaning. Here's our guide to understanding the significance of June 4 for China and Hong Kong, and what may happen next.  In the spring of 1989, thousands of Chinese students marched into Beijing's Tiananmen Square to call for democracy. Following weeks of peaceful protests, troops acted on the orders of Chinese Communist Party leaders to open fire on civilians and students in the early hours of June 4, ending the mass demonstrations. Though no official figure has been announced, the death toll is estimated to range from several hundred to thousands. Read: Tiananmen Square facts  Chinese censors have blocked the search results of "June 4" and "Tiananmen Square" on the Internet. If mentioned at all in textbooks and campuses, the crackdown is described as an "incident" or a "counterrevolutionary riot" that deserved to be suppressed. Last month, a Chinese student studying abroad penned an open letter, co-signed by 10 other overseas Chinese students, calling for students in mainland China to discuss the Tiananmen Square crackdown. A state-run Chinese newspaper quickly condemned the letter for "twisting the facts of 26 years ago with narratives of some overseas hostile forces."  Every year on June 4, many Hong Kongers hold a massive candlelight vigil in Victoria Park to honor those killed in 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Some mainland Chinese people attend the vigil as well. The vigil is also a expression of fierce discontent with the governments of China and Hong Kong as participants shout political slogans calling for the overthrow of the Chinese Communist Party and the resignation of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed chief executive. In recent years, the crowds have swelled in size as anxiety grows over China's increasing influence in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Last year, the world's first June 4 Memorial Museum opened in Hong Kong.  When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years and eventually develop an election system based on universal suffrage. But nobody agrees on what that actually means. Last year, China proposed letting Hong Kongers vote for their next leader -- as long as candidates are first approved by a small Beijing-backed committee. Infuriated by that proposal, pro-democracy Hong Kongers organized massive street protests that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for 79 days last fall. Those demonstrations -- known as "Occupy" or the "Umbrella Movement" -- were ultimately dispersed by police but deepened rifts in the city and angered Beijing.  Last fall's Occupy movement birthed a new generation of young pro-democracy Hong Kongers who organize on the Internet, refuse to identify as Chinese and are eager for aggressive confrontation. They've lost patience with Hong Kong's older generation of activists, who identify with the movement for democracy in China but have failed to secure tangible democratic gains for Hong Kong. That's why some younger protesters are refusing to attend this year's mass vigil run by the older activists. Some of them see the goal of building a democratic China -- as implied by the remembrance of Tiananmen -- as a distraction from their struggle for democracy in Hong Kong.  In just a few weeks, Hong Kong legislators are expected to vote on the electoral reform proposed by Beijing. But pro-democracy lawmakers have just enough votes to veto the plan, which needs two-thirds majority to pass. Activists have threatened new protests and Beijing has not banned assemblies related to June 4 in Hong Kong. However, local authorities have made it clear that they will not tolerate Occupy-style demonstrations again. Meanwhile, rising housing prices and a growing wealth gap exacerbate discontent among many Hong Kongers. Local and international groups also say press freedom has declined dramatically in the city. No matter the vote's outcome, new confrontations within the increasingly fractured city are all but guaranteed. Distrust runs deep, and nobody has been able to come up with a compromise acceptable to all sides.  </corpo>

            <descricao>It's the surprisingly complex story of a city struggling to transition from colonial to Chinese rule.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Could Hong Kong's fight for democracy be entering its final round? Six months after the end of the massive "Occupy" protests that paralyzed the city's streets last fall, another pivotal confrontation is brewing in the former British colony. It comes down to a Beijing-backed bill that could decide Hong Kong's future. Lawmakers begin debating the bill Wednesday. If it passes, the city will be able to vote for its own leaders -- as long as China approves the candidates. If it doesn't pass, Hong Kongers may never be able to vote for their leaders at all. It's a surprisingly complex story of a city struggling to transition from colonial to Chinese rule. How did we get here, and what's coming next? Our guide will get you up to speed.  Hong Kong is a small piece of land colonized by the British in 1841 and returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The majority of its 7 million people speak Cantonese, whereas most people in China speak Mandarin. Officially, Hong Kong is a Chinese "special administrative region", under a principle called "One Country, Two Systems." In practice, that means Hong Kong is a Chinese territory, but maintains its own currency, government, and laws: Websites like Facebook and Twitter aren't blocked here, residents can protest and criticize the government, and the press is not censored by law. This special status is set to expire in the year 2047.  It's about a deal that hasn't been fulfilled. When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years and eventually develop an election system based on universal suffrage. But nobody agrees on what that actually means. Read more: What is 'One Country, Two Systems'? Many Hong Kongers strongly believe the city is entitled to free and open elections -- an interpretation that local authorities, backed by Beijing, staunchly oppose. Years of negotiations have failed to yield an agreement. The conflict peaked dramatically last fall as pro-democracy Hong Kongers staged massive street occupations paralyzing key parts of the city in a bid to pressure authorities to make concessions. That movement, known as "Occupy Hong Kong" or the "Umbrella Movement," enjoyed popular support among Hong Kong's youth and drew headlines around the world. No matter: The government refused to budge, condemning the protests and eventually clearing the sites after 79 days. Watch more: What's next for Hong Kong's 'Generation Occupy'?  Chinese authorities have proposed what they say is a fair and final offer: Hong Kongers may vote for their next leader, as long as the candidates are narrowed down and approved by the Chinese government. A rolling poll of Hong Kongers shows views on the proposal are split down the middle -- nearly as many residents support it as oppose it. This week, the city's Legislative Council will vote on the proposal: The bill needs two-thirds of the chamber's support to become law. But just over one-third of the chamber is controlled by pro-democracy politicians, and they've sworn to veto the bill. It doesn't seem likely that the Chinese government's proposal will pass.  If Beijing's plan gets vetoed, the existing system for electing the city's leader will remain. That is, he or she will be chosen by a small committee that's stacked with Beijing loyalists. Here's the ominous part for the city's pro-democracy activists: Central authorities have warned this may be Hong Kong's last chance to have "democracy." If this proposal gets shot down, then there won't be a new proposal -- possibly ever, they say. However, the activists aren't buying it. They're determined to fight for "real universal suffrage" -- an election in which anyone can run and anyone can vote. They haven't given a clear explanation of how they plan to achieve this. But if the past is any indication, they'll continue to try a mix of negotiation, campaigning, and civil disobedience -- again, and again, and again.  The increasingly intense struggle for democracy has created a new era in Hong Kong's political climate. A generational gap has opened up between young people, who tend to support democratic reforms, and the older generation, who are comparatively more sympathetic to the establishment. Meanwhile, the share of Hong Kongers who identify as Chinese has dropped. Some ardently anti-mainland activists -- known as "localists" -- have grown more vocal since last fall's Occupy movement. A radical minority of them go as far as to advocate for an independent Hong Kong. Localists found themselves under scrutiny Monday after police arrested 10 people with suspected ties to "local radical groups" in an alleged bomb plot -- though pro-democracy activists have questioned the validity of the accusations. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are concerned about skyrocketing rents, increasing inequality, and diminishing press freedom. However, residents are divided over how much of these issues can be blamed on China's influence. That leads to the big question of what happens after 2047, when Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status expires. Will Hong Kong be allowed to retain control over its own affairs? Will it maintain its local character? Or will it become indistinguishable from other Chinese cities? Pro-democracy Hong Kongers are deeply skeptical that the Chinese Communist Party will loosen its grip. Rather, China's authoritarian influence over the city only seems to grow -- from their perspective, the days in which Hong Kong can enjoy its unique rights and freedoms are numbered.  </corpo>

            <corpo>London (CNN)It's the final day of men's fashion week in London, and a crowd has gathered inside the Old Sorting Office, a former industrial site, to watch models work the runway. Dylan Jones, the editor of style bible GQ, sits on the front row, just a few seats down from David Gandy, one of the world's most sought-after male models, perhaps most recognized when wearing only a pair of briefs. Yet among the British fashion-savvy, it's a Chinese celebrity who turns the most heads. Wearing golden sneakers and a white suit, Hu Bing carries himself with the confidence and grace you'd expect from China's top male model, who just happens to be a former Olympic rower, a part-time singer and one of China's best-known actors. Hu, now 45, has worked for Cartier, Dunhill, Gucci, and Ferragamo, among others, and now he's working for the British Fashion Council (BFC) — the body that promotes British fashion internationally. As its first international style ambassador, Hu will champion British fashion in his homeland and beyond. "The Chinese like British brands, but they don't say 'British fashion,'" he says. "They just say 'European fashion.' Sometimes they mix up London, Paris, and Milan, when the fashion is all totally different." Indeed, Hu has a challenge on his hands. In the most recent World Luxury Index, French and Italian fashion brands, led by Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Gucci, dominated the list of the most sought-after luxury fashion labels in China. Burberry was the only British brand in the Top 10. "I need to do a lot of work," Hu says. "I have a responsibility to present London fashion as London fashion." He knows that London has a reputation for the tailoring of Saville Row and the timeless Burberry trench coat, but Hu believes the USP of British fashion comes from its whimsy. "London is more easygoing and more fun," he says. "Designers are more afraid in Asia — and in New York and Paris. But in London people really just enjoy themselves. They feel confidant. That is the difference." "I've been to many different cities for Fashion Week — Milan, Paris, New York City. But London is the most amazing city for me right now. In five years I want London Fashion Week to be number one."  Like a model balancing in her stilettos, luxury brands in China occasionally wobble. In 2014 the once bullish Chinese luxury market posted its first year of negative growth, shrinking by 1% according to Bain &amp; Co. And in the year leading to April 2015, Prada closed 16 stores in China, while Armani shut five. China's economy may be slowing down, but the British Fashion Council have still made a clever play by drafting Hu as its suited and booted fashion envoy. Despite the broader picture, sales of menswear in China actually climbed 7% last year, according to Euromonitor, and menswear now accounts for a larger chunk of apparel sales than womenswear. Euromonitor forecasts that China — currently the fifth largest market for luxury menswear globally — will climb to second, behind the United States, by 2017. The number of Chinese press and buyers attending men's fashion week (officially known as London Collections: Men) has nearly doubled since the first showcase in 2012. The market slant towards menswear is driven partly by China's "One-Child Policy" and cultural values that stress the primacy of men over women. Chinese men are increasingly concerned with image and, owing to rising incomes, more likely to trade up the fashion ladder. Hu also sees it as a matter of playing catch-up with China's women. "In China, the lady's closet is almost full," he says. "But men, before they had no clothes, so now they need to buy a lot. They want to dress up and shine."  And when they do, the British Fashion Council is betting that China's men will look to Hu for inspiration. After all: he has 10 million followers on China's microblogging site Weibo. "We are thrilled that Hu Bing has become an International Ambassador for London Collections Men, as his enormous influence, knowledge of the Chinese market and enthusiasm for fashion makes him a perfect choice," Dylan Jones, the chair of LCM, said when announcing the selection earlier this spring. "Having an International Ambassador in China is key to the development of London Collections Men." As part of that development, Hu will educate British fashion houses about the immense and varied Chinese market and counter what he sees as bizarre stereotypes. "I'm here in Europe and I'm surprised that everybody is saying that Chinese people are too serious and not funny," he says. "It's not true. Chinese are interested in new things, and are traveling everywhere in the world." Their bold, international tastes come through in the Chinese designers showing in London. You can't call them pedestrian. Take designer Sean Suen, who, on June 15, sent male models down the runway wearing high-fashion aprons and metallic, open-toed sandals. Hu says that the smartest brands won't try their luck when opening new stores, but will invest the time to conduct longer searches. "You need to know the real China," he says, pointing out that what's "real" changes with the wind. "Every three months you need to update your marketing information. Things happen too fast in China." He also points out that just as fashion varies from London to Paris to Milan, it also varies within China's biggest fashion hubs Shanghai and Beijing. Hu says Shanghai is comparable Tokyo, where people are more likely to keep it simple and conform, while Beijing is akin to anything-goes New York. "In Shanghai, the look is really Japanese. They like to do one thing. It's never four, five, or six. But in Beijing it's like one to ten — it's total freedom."   </corpo>

            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Now breathe. Almost 9.5 million high school students in China have just finished possibly the most important exam of their lives. The annual National College Entrance Exams -- or gaokao -- are the only way to get into college. Failure means no degree, poorer job prospects and possibly a life of regret.

Please write a letter based on the given information to the daughter, the father or the police officer, in no fewer than 800 words.  Everybody has tough and soft spots in his/her heart. Whether you can reach an inner harmony depends on how you balance the toughness and softness. Please choose an angle and write an essay on this topic in 800 words or more.  An honest person may not be smart, yet a smart person may not have true wisdom. Please write an essay in no fewer than 800 words on this topic.  After getting on a bus, a little boy asked the bus driver to wait for his mother. A minute passed and the mother didn't show up. Passengers complained loudly and the boy was brought to tears. When the mother finally caught up with the bus, everybody went silent -- she is disabled. Write an essay in 800 words or more based on the given information.  Please write an essay based on three sentences given: a) Originally there was no path in this world, but after many who have walked upon it, a path came into being. b) Even if you choose a wrong way to go, it's a meaningful one anyway. c) There's no path in the world that you can't walk upon; there are only people who dare not step on it.

            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Spectacular, rarely seen images of China's railways - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>From a part-time rail buff to a full-fledged photographer, Wang Wei runs all over China to capture stunning train photos.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)China's rail system is one enormous mass of statistics. It's 120,000 kilometers long (second largest in the world after the United States) and has the highest passenger-per-kilometer ratio in the world -- 1,060 billion passengers in 2013, according to the National Railway Administration of China). But for one Beijing-based "photoworm" -- as photographers are dubbed in China -- it's far more beautiful than a bunch of big numbers. Wang Wei, 25, is possibly the most passionate rail fan in China. Over the past decade he's braved frostbite, unreliable timetables and months away from home while traveling an estimated 300,000 kilometers to capture the country's rail network and its trains in pictures. It's been more than two years since CNN interviewed the then recent university graduate and railway obsessive. Since then, Wang has become a mini-celebrity. He's been interviewed by more than 20 Chinese and overseas media outlets, and even been the subject of a Chinese television documentary. What's more, he has two books being published in China later this year. "Zhui Huo Che" (Running After Trains) is a photo book featuring his experiences and photography techniques. "My Jing-Zhang Railway" is an illustrated book showcasing Wang's photos and interviews with people who have worked and lived on the Beijing-Zhangjiangkou line, China's first Chinese-designed and built railway. "Chinese official have seldom promoted the beauty of the railway and trains," says Wang. "They have never taken pictures of what I've been taken. "Instead, they take photos of leaders delivering a speech, cutting ribbons. "I feel the railway belongs to each of us, everyone has the responsibility to promote it if they love it." CNN: It's been two years since we last talked. Where have you been lately? Wang Wei: The 200-kilometer Southern Xinjiang Railway (Tianshan Mountain section) stopped running in February 2015, so I brought my dad and three friends there last December. It was really cold in Southern Xinjiang in December -- around minus 30C (minus 22F). Even worse, we were told there were wolves in the area and they're very active at night, which was during my shooting times. We decided to dig a hole and burn branches inside. The fire helped us drive away the wolves and warm ourselves. Most important, I got the photos I want. I also visited Japan and Germany in the last two years. CNN: What impressed you the most during the trips? Wang: The railway culture of Japan and Germany moved me a lot. In Germany, they can buy the abandoned rails and trains for cheap, about RMB100,000 ($16,110) for two compartments, which is around one-tenth of the price in China. They (often) retain the original look of their rail cars and turn them into hostels and restaurants. Really lovely. In Japan, when I took photos of the trains, the staff was friendly and gave me useful instructions like where to get the good angles and so on. This is impossible in China. Here the staff will only tell you go away. You can also see quite a number of books featuring railways in Japan. We have very limited materials on railways in China. The length of China's railway system is the second longest in the world, and the history of Chinese railways is more than 100 years old. I really wish the culture of the Chinese railways can catch up. CNN: How did you get into railway photography? Wang: I am a Beijing native and grew up by a train station. I started taking railway photos in 2005 when I was 15. I have a deep connection with the trains and railways. From my window (in my home), I can see trains every day. The first photos I took were of trains at Beijing North Railway Station, which is next to my place. CNN: What's the secret of a good railroad photo? Wang: I usually make a plan two or three days before shooting. According to the train schedule, color and type, I will think about light and background -- should it be directly light or back lit, things like that. It's actually not too complicated. CNN: Which have been your favorites places? Wang: The Greater Khingan Mountains. The Qinghai-Tibet extension rail. South of Xinjiang. And the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's China section. CNN: Any new trends in the train industry you've noticed? Wang: The new high-speed trains are a growing influence everywhere. In my eyes, the new trains aren't as beautiful as old locomotives. However, from a passenger's perspective, it's good to enhance the speed. CNN: What equipment do you use? Wang: A Nikon D800 and a 28-300 VR lens. It usually happens all of a sudden -- the train comes and there's no extra time for me to change lenses so I need a multiple-use, long-haul lens like that. CNN: How do you travel to your destinations? Wang: I use every form of transportation depending on where I go. Trains and cars half of the time, and on foot the other half. During my trip to northeast China in October 2011, I walked more than 186 kilometers in 15 days, not including the mountains I climbed. It was the only way I could reach the places I wanted to go. CNN: How long do your photo expeditions usually take? Wang: Depends where I go -- the journey usually takes from 10 days to a month. The longest journey I took was a 56-day trip covering seven provinces -- Beijing, Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shannxi, Yunnan and Guizhou in the summer of 2011. CNN: Any difficulties during any of your missions? Wang: To me, the difficulties are finding angles and waiting for trains. I love the high angle, so I usually climb mountains to take photos. Some of the mountains are steep and have dangerous wildlife, like snakes. So I need to be very careful. At night, it's even harder to climb. The trains often change schedules according to the weather or other unpredictable reasons, so it's quite normal for me to wait in one spot a whole day without seeing a train. CNN: Is your family supportive? Wang: Like many Chinese parents, they thought I should go to college and get a degree. So at first they didn't support me at all. But when they heard the experiences of my journeys and saw my photos were getting better and better, they were OK with it. My dad sometimes will join me on photo shoots.

            <corpo>(CNN)Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, was moved 3 centimeters (about 1.2 inches) southwest by the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that devastated Nepal in April, Chinese authorities say. But the April 25 quake, which left more than 8,000 people dead, did not affect the height of the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain, according to the report by China's National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation. Chinese state media reported the administration had set a satellite monitoring system on the peak in 2005 to observe the movement of the mountain. In the decade since, Everest had been moving northeast at a speed of 4 centimeters a year, and had grown by 0.3 centimeters annually, state media reported. The April earthquake reversed the direction of the mountain, shifting it to roughly where it would have been nine months earlier. Nepal reopens 7 historic sites after quakes It triggered a number of avalanches on and around the mountain -- which is at the border of Nepal and China -- claiming the lives of many climbers. The deaths led mountaineering companies to call off their climbs for the rest of the season. Heroes' dreams 'scattered' by quake New data showed a second deadly quake in Nepal, which struck on May 12 with a magnitude of 7.5, did not move the mountain, state media reported. Previous analyses by seismologists have said that the mountain probably shifted by as much as meters in the quake, but the height was probably unchanged.

            <descricao>The highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges was sentenced Thursday to life in prison, China's top court says. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges has been sentenced to life in prison, according to a statement Thursday from China's Supreme People's Court. Zhou Yongkang, the country's former security chief, received the sentence after being found guilty of taking bribes, China's top court said, citing the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in northeastern China. Zhou, 72, also received seven years for abusing power and four years for deliberately revealing state secrets. Footage from the court in Tianjin, not far from the Chinese capital, Beijing, showed Zhou looking healthy but now with white hair. He said, "I have acknowledged the fact of my committed crimes, and the loss that was caused to the party's mission. Hereby I am pleading guilty and I am regretful of it." As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." But prosecutors said Zhou took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepted large amounts of money during his long political career. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested in December before being formally charged in April. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign, targeting both "tigers" and "flies" -- high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Who is Zhou Yongkang? CNN's Steven Jiang reported and wrote from Beijing, and CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's David McKenzie and Kevin Wang contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Sex trade goes underground in China's 'sin city' - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The go-go days of Dongguan's red light district might be over but it doesn't mean the sex industry has disappeared. Rather, the trade has gone underground.</descricao>
            <corpo>Dongguan, China (CNN)When Han Yulai, a businessman in Dongguan, a town in southern China's manufacturing heartland, had clients in town for a factory visit or trade fairs, he would always offer them what he calls the "Dongguan standard." In the evening, he'd take them to a KTV, a karaoke entertainment establishment often synonymous with sexual services. There, a "mamasan" -- a name given to a woman in charge of running businesses at brothels -- would line up a dozen young women, mainly Chinese but also Japanese, Korean and -- the most expensive of all -- Russians. "You choose one or two, sing and drink and have a bit of fun, and then go to a room upstairs for some 'business.' Not love, only business," said Han, who used a pseudonym as prostitution is illegal in China. Today, doing that type of business is becoming increasingly difficult. In February 2014, the government launched a crackdown on the sex trade in Dongguan, which has been dubbed China's "Sin City." More than 2,000 hotels, saunas and massage parlors that catered to the city's migrant workers and visiting buyers were shut down, according to state media. Thousands of people were arrested, including suspected operators and organizers of prostitution, alongside high-ranking officials and corrupt police officers. The city's vice mayor, who was also head of the city's public security bureau, Yan Xiaokang, was removed from his posts. The raids lasted several months and their impact is still being felt more than a year later.  Indeed, at my hotel, a four-star establishment in the heart of Houjie, one of the red light districts, the massage and sauna floor still remain closed. So are spas and KTV facilities at other hotels in the area that I visited. On the streets, not one single "xiaojie" -- the Chinese word for miss that's also slang for prostitute -- is to be seen. In barbershops, often a front for sex services, staff seem to actually focus on customers' hair and nothing else. Lin Jiang, a professor of public finance and taxation at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, estimated that the raids could wipe out out 50 billion yuan ($8 billion) for businesses, including hotels, shops and restaurants. That's a tenth of Dongguan's city revenue in 2014. He says it's impossible to know exactly what the financial losses were because officials have been too secretive. "We can only estimate, we can't get the data to prove it." Lin says the crackdown has caused financial pain in more ways than one. Dongguan's economy has traditionally relied on low-cost manufacturing. Efforts at growing high-end service industries and advanced manufacturing have been hampered by the high profile prostitution crackdown. "The anti-vice campaign has hurt the city's image and this shadow won't completely disappear," he told CNN. Han, the businessman, agrees. "We absolutely have fewer customers coming to Dongguan now than a year ago." READ: Police on alert after sex industry crackdown  But even if the go-go days of Dongguan's red light district are over, it doesn't mean the sex industry has disappeared. Rather, the trade has gone underground. Han can no longer openly take customers to KTVs or saunas for the "Dongguan standard," but there are ways of flying under the radar, he said, like having your own contacts with go-betweens and "mamasans." Getting contacts was far from difficult, as I experienced myself. Coming back to my hotel one night, I was approached by the lobby boy. "You like massage?" he asked with a cheeky smile. For 1,000 yuan ($160) I was offered 90 minutes in my room with "two beautiful Chinese girls." He gave me his number. Right before the lift doors closed, he winked at me and made a risqué hand gesture suggesting a type of sexual service. A hotel chauffeur also offered his services. As we were driving along a busy highway, he turned back to me and said "anmo, anmo?" -- massage in Chinese -- and made suggestive gestures with his fingers. I said I'd think about it and he gave me his business card. In less than a day, I had two local pimps at hand should their services be required.  Social media apps are also being used to connect supply and demand, especially China's mainstream instant messaging service WeChat. Since the women can't work at KTVs anymore, some of them instead linger around the building waiting for men to seek out their services. By searching "People nearby" and selecting "Female only" you get a list of WeChat users in the area. Looking at their profile pictures, it doesn't take much imagination to figure out who's in business. But using social media services is also getting increasingly difficult as China's Internet regulator is clamping down on sexual content. Chinese media reports that the sex trade is also believed to have shifted to one-on-one home service and phone appointments and on the streets during my visit, I didn't see any sex workers.  More than 250,000 sex workers were estimated to have worked in Dongguan before the government took action. Critics of the raids say the new underground environment has exposed sex workers to greater risks. "Sex workers have always been abused by the clients and the police. After the crackdown the situation is the same. They are still subject to violence from these to groups," said Ann Lee, a spokesperson for Zi Teng, a Hong Kong-based sex workers' rights group. Human Rights Watch said in a 2013 report that sex workers in China are subject to serious abuses, including police violence, arbitrary detention and coercive HIV testing. The police often fail to investigate crimes against sex workers by clients, it said. Global Times, a newspaper under the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, quoted people as saying the crackdown is hurting an already disadvantaged group, and raised the possibility of decriminalizing the industry, "as sexual freedom is arguably a human right." Lee hopes one day the sex trade could become "just one normal business activity" with healthier control and regulations. "But in China, that's just a dream. It's still too controversial," she added.  Most of the entertainment venues closed by police last year have been allowed to reopen and stricter rules took effect in April, according to Chinese media. The new rules include: Banning massages in private rooms with locked doors or lights turned off; identifying overnight guests to local police; and banning employees from offering services away from massage parlors. However, local pharmacies in red light districts continue to display ads for Viagra in their shop windows, with both original and ripoffs for sale. A pharmacist laughed when asked if there's still demand for the potency pills after the crackdown. "Yes," he said, "Especially at night time."

            <cabecalho>China: Young people seek out no-frills weddings - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>With the average Chinese wedding now costing $20,000, some couples are looking for cheaper alternatives. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Shiny rings, white gowns and luxury cars filled the mammoth national convention center, next to the Chinese capital's Olympic Bird's Nest stadium, one recent weekend. Armed with balloons, teddy bears and goody bags filled with coupons, throngs of salespeople stood outside their booths, shoving free gifts into the hands of visitors in an attempt to turn them into clients. Spread across two floors, more than 200 vendors competed at Beijing's Olympic-sized wedding expo for the attention -- and, more importantly, the wallets -- of thousands of young couples. PHOTOS: Tibetan couple's unconventional wedding pictures go viral  Everything was on sale at a discount, but even a rough calculation on site pointed to the soaring cost of getting married in China. The total bill could easily exceed $20,000 -- an unimaginable sum just a few years ago -- counting a pair of rings, a bridal gown, a banquet, a photo shoot and a professional planner. In the United States, the average cost of a wedding -- excluding a honeymoon -- has a similar price tag of $25,200, according to the latest figure released by the Wedding Report, a market research firm. Although rapid economic growth has brought rising incomes, the average Chinese still makes only a fraction of their American counterpart. Government statistics show the annual disposable income for 2014 was only $3,283 per person in China. The ballooning cost of weddings has spurred a multi-billion-dollar industry, but also put a heavy burden on the more than 10 million couples marrying every year in the world's most populous nation, especially those who already feel financially strained trying to buy their first home and car. READ: How to get ahead on China's dating scene Faced with a deep-rooted cultural preference for marriage, however, young Chinese preparing to tie the knot admit that cutting back is not always an option. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime event -- so I have to show my commitment to her and her parents through the wedding," explained Wang Di, 23, who was looking for good deals at the expo even though he and his girlfriend don't plan to walk down the aisle for another two years. "We may not care that much about the ceremony -- but the parents and other relatives do."  Frustrated with family pressure, some rebellious Chinese couples have chosen to enter so-called "naked marriages" with no houses, no cars, no weddings -- and sometimes no rings. While the public seems to appreciate the philosophy of true love trumping everything else, most respondents in repeated surveys still reject the notion of disavowing all traditional trappings of marriage. Increasingly, though, less radical -- but more creative and affordable -- ideas are gaining popularity in big cities. At a courtyard house in suburban Beijing one recent Saturday, the dress code was casual, but everyone appeared to be having some serious fun at the bride and groom's "do-it-yourself" wedding. On stage, the bride had already kicked off her high-heels. The venue was the couple's home -- rented for only $2,500 a year from a local farmer. The decoration that emphasized fresh flowers and entertainment -- featuring a DJ and a band -- were both courtesy of their artistic friends. Adorning the brick walls were various home-made movie-style posters starring the bride and groom, including one showing them laughing in bed with the phrase "mad love" in bold yellow lettering splashed across the red duvet covering their bodies. READ: Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market  "Almost every wedding now goes through the same drill and I don't want that," said bride Zhang Yueyue, a marketing manager at an arts magazine. "I think letting everyone have fun is the most important thing. Many Chinese weddings now are more about flaunting wealth and letting parents have 'face' through extravagance." Counting catering and tailor-made traditional Chinese dresses, Zhang and her artist husband spent less than $2,000 on their big day. With their modest incomes, the newlyweds agreed that saving from the wedding meant more money to start their married life together. Amid loud cheers and applause in the courtyard, some of the couple's guests already felt inspired. "My budget won't be high either," said Zhao Mengsha, a colleague and friend of the bride who is planning her own summer wedding. "I just want a big party with some entertainment -- and most importantly lots of alcohol." That definitely sounds like a winning formula for a special occasion.

            <descricao>At the height of his power, Zhou Yongkang controlled police forces, spy agencies and court systems in China. He now has been sentenced to life in prison.</descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)At the height of his power, Zhou Yongkang controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and the domestic security czar wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." Before retiring in 2012, Zhou saw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the 2 million-strong Chinese military -- the world's largest. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Away from the spotlight, though, Zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth. The allegedly blatant exchange between money and power, as revealed by China's state media, would eventually prompt Zhou's shocking downfall. He's the most senior official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic of China.  After months of intense political rumors, the Communist Party's disciplinary arm in July announced a formal investigation into Zhou for "serious disciplinary violations." In December, state-run Xinhua news agency reported his arrest after the Communist leadership expelled him from the party. And in April, state prosecutors revealed he had been formally charged with accepting bribes, abuse of power and leaking state secrets. After a criminal trial held in Tianjin, a city near Beijing, he was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes. Zhou, 72, also received seven years for abusing power and four years for deliberately revealing state secrets. Party investigators also accused Zhou of having affairs with multiple women, and trading power and money for sex. Read: China announces investigation into security czar  Many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign ostensibly targeting "tigers and flies" -- high-ranking and low-level officials alike. "The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members," said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Unlike Xi, who is "Communist royalty" thanks to his father's status as one of Mao Zedong's comrades in arms during the revolution, Zhou was born to a poor family in eastern China. His father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school. Smart and hardworking, Zhou didn't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in Beijing. That school, now called China University of Petroleum, was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry. After graduating with a degree in oil exploration, Zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. Described by many as a capable and humble young party cadre, Zhou was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge. His political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in Beijing, which later became a giant state-owned oil company and one of Zhou's power bases. Read: In China, 'everyone is guilty of corruption'  Overcoming factional wars in the ministry, Zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects, a two-pronged strategy that would continue to this day. Fast growth of business abroad made supervision from Beijing harder, sowing the seeds for corruption. In 2001, after a stint as minister of land resources, Zhou was named the Communist Party chief of Sichuan, one of the country's most populous provinces. State media there portrayed Zhou as an eloquent leader with a clear vision, and gave him credit for luring high-tech companies, including Intel, to the southwestern province as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors. Zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from Beijing -- in key postings throughout the province. Zhou's big break came in 2002 when he returned to Beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security, which runs the country's police forces. Five years later, he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the Politburo Standing Committee -- with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs. His reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 60th anniversary of the Communist rule in 2009 and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010.  As the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else, Zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already-limited judicial independence, cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists. It was also during this period that Zhou became a patron of Bo Xilai, a fast-rising political star who was waging a controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing. Bo's spectacular downfall in 2012 -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. Read: Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal Bo supporters, however, have long called him a political victim as the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political activists and observers now note the similarity between the Bo and Zhou cases. "Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs," said Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on "subversion" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement. "The bottom line is: All officials are corrupt," he added. "Xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption -- something that helps him win the masses' hearts and minds." Lam, the Hong Kong analyst, said. "The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles. People who are close to Xi are less liable to becoming incriminated."  Those close to Zhou have fallen with him. State media have reported official investigations -- and formal arrests in some cases -- of dozens of Zhou's family members and former aides. The biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Details have also emerged in Chinese media about possible skeletons in Zhou's closet, including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife. Most stories, though, have focused on the vast wealth amassed by Zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families. The Zhous reportedly benefited immensely from China's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to Zhou's deep ties to the two related ministries. Zhou's older son, who is 42, is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars. Before turning 30, the younger Zhou had quick success in business after winning a contract to upgrade IT systems for 8,000 gas stations across China. His companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations. State media reports also indicated that one of Zhou's younger brothers, a onetime farmer, used Zhou's influence to launch a "crisis management" business and profited from helping people get out of jail, enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state-owned oil fields. Other published articles have depicted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure. "I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved," analyst Lam said. "His only incentive now is to protect his son -- he will toe the line to protect his son." Read: Is China's corruption crackdown really a political purge?  </corpo>

            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)China's foreign ministry says it will soon complete controversial land reclamation on some islands and reefs in disputed waters in the South China Sea. However, the ministry also said in a statement released Tuesday that it planned to build facilities on the artificial islands it has created and these would perform several tasks -- including military defense. "According to the planned operation, China is about to complete the land reclamation operation at some of the Nansha islands where China has been stationed," the statement said. It did not give a time frame. China has placed artillery pieces on one of its manufactured islands, the U.S. says, and China has announced plans for two lighthouses.  Last year, China stepped up land reclamation on several reefs in contested waters close to the Spratly Islands (called Nansha by China), alarming its Asian neighbors. The United States says that China has reclaimed some 2,000 acres -- 1,500 football fields -- in the past 18 months and has called for an "immediate and lasting" halt to the island building. In May, a U.S. surveillance plane carrying a CNN crew flew over some of China's artificial islands, triggered eight warnings from the Chinese navy to back off. The South China Sea is the subject of numerous rival -- often messy -- territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of several island chains and nearby waters. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. China reiterated that its construction did not target any other countries or affect freedom of navigation by sea or air.

            <corpo>(CNN)North Korea test-fired three short-range anti-ship missiles off its east coast on Sunday, a South Korean defense official told CNN. "North Korea on June 14 fired three KN-01 missiles near North Korea's eastern city towards sea off east of the peninsula," the South Korean Defense Ministry official said. The missiles were reportedly fired between 4:21 p.m. and 4:47 p.m. (3:21 a.m. to 3:47 a.m. ET), according to South Korea. "The missile test follows the one from February and May," the official said. "Our military is closely monitoring North Korea's movement and is maintaining all military readiness posture for any provocation." According to globalsecurity.org, the KN-01 surface-to-surface missile has a range of 120 kilometers, about 75 miles. North Korea first test-fired such missiles years ago, at least according to reports from the South Korean government. The Global Security website quotes the South Korean Ministry of Defense as saying that North Korea conducted "10 test launches of its KN-01 anti-ship cruise missile between February 2003 and June 2007."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Nearly two months after suffering a 7.8 magnitude quake, authorities have reopened all of Nepal's seven world heritage sites, and other historic monuments.</descricao>
            <corpo>Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)Nearly two months after an earthquake killed almost 9,000 people and razed parts of the capital Kathmandu and rural villages, Nepal's authorities have reopened all its seven world heritage sites, which had been closed since the April 25 disaster. Following extensive cleanup work the sites are once again open to visitors. "We had closed these sites since the debris and rubble from the religious monuments damaged by the earthquake had to be removed," Department of Archaeology spokesperson Ram Bahadur Kunwar told CNN. He added that the artifacts of archaeological importance also had to be secured.  According to Department of Archaeology data 443 archaeological monuments, including temples, in three districts throughout Kathmandu Valley were affected by the quake. Among the sites opened on Monday were the three Durbar Squares of Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur -- ancient cities and home to centuries-old, unique pagoda-style temples. The country is still suffering aftershocks from the 7.8-magnitude quake, and not all areas of the heritage sites have been opened, since there is still a danger of collapse in some areas of the temple complexes, Kunwar said. The government plans to reconstruct, renovate and conserve all monuments damaged in the quake within five to seven years, at a cost of $70 to 100 million.  The Himalayan country's government has called an international donors' meeting on June 25 to raise $2 billion for reconstruction and rehabilitation throughout the country. The three Durbar Squares, along with the other four Hindu and Buddhist monuments which make up the seven UNESCO world heritage sites, attract hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. "By opening these sites we are trying to give the message to the world that normal life is returning," said Sarad Pradhan, media consultant of Nepal Tourism Board. "We hope that the return of tourists will restore livelihoods of people who depend on tourism."  </corpo>

            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Ten people, some with alleged ties to a radical political organization, have been arrested in Hong Kong, accused of conspiring to manufacture explosives, police in the Chinese territory say. At a news conference Monday, police said they had arrested five men and four women, ranging in age from 21 to 34, whom they described as members of a "local syndicate." A tenth person, a 58-year-old man, was arrested Monday afternoon at Lo Wu, a border crossing between Hong Kong and Mainland China. Police said their investigations showed that two men in the group were planning to test the powder of an explosive device. They raided a location in the territory's remote Sai Kung district Sunday evening, where they arrested the pair, seized chemicals and detonated explosives. Chemicals recovered during a subsequent house search were tested and found to be precursors of TATP, a highly volatile explosive thought to have been used in the 2005 London bombings and other terror attacks. Officers also found the chemical formula for manufacturing smoke grenades, police said. Police then swooped on others linked to the pair, and also seized air rifles, "V for Vendetta"-style face masks, political stickers and pamphlets, computers containing a sketch of an explosive device, and maps showing locations in Admiralty and Wan Chai -- districts where the city's government is based. Police would not say whether the maps identified targets where the explosives were intended to be used, or whether authorities were working with China's People's Liberation Army, which also has a base in Admiralty. "There are maps that show the locations of Admiralty and Wan Chai, and there are possibilities that this group of people might want to do something in this particular location," said Au Chin-chau, chief superintendent of the police Organized Crime and Triad Bureau. Police said some members of the group claimed to be members of a local radical organization. Police would not name the organization. The arrests took place in an abandoned TV studio in Sai Kung. Now derelict and covered in graffiti, the studio is a popular place for photo shoots, teenager parties and paintball-like games with airsoft guns.  News of the arrests came a day after thousands of pro-democracy protesters returned to Hong Kong streets, nine months after a demonstration that triggered 79 days of heated occupations in the semiautonomous Chinese city-state. A prominent leader of those protests, Joshua Wong, 18, said that there was a lack of evidence and that the arrests were a "farce" to smear localists, a group of hardline pro-Hong Kong, anti-Mainland demonstrators. Read more: Who is Joshua Wong? "Even if you wanted to storm the Legislative Council, you wouldn't make explosives to get in, it's not reasonable," he told CNN. He also questioned why any suspects, who have yet to be named, would readily admit they were affiliated with a local radical group. "No matter who did it, the government successfully vilifies the localists," he said, adding that he did not identify as a localist. Ronald Leung, a spokesman for a hardline localist group, repudiated the idea of making explosives. But he speculated that if police allegations were true, it could reflect the level of frustration developing for a minority in the pro-democracy camp. "It's sad, because it shows that the rule of the central and local governments has failed, and people have only become angrier," he said. "It is only inevitable that people will find more and more radical ways of resistance." Political tension has ramped up in recent days as Hong Kong's government prepares to table a Beijing-backed reform package ahead of Hong Kong's 2017 elections. The proposal, if approved, would allow Hong Kongers to cast votes for their next leader -- if the candidates are first vetted by China. But pro-democracy legislators, who have just enough votes to veto the bill, have sworn to do just that. Wong told CNN on Monday that the chance of it passing was "zero." CNN's Ivan Watson, Bex Wright, Vivian Kam and Agnes Chan contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Migrant organization: Australia shirking obligations - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Australia says it will uphold obligations to seaborne migrants, but International Organization for Migration (IOM) says payments to traffickers unethical.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The Australian government stands accused of shirking its international obligations to migrants following allegations it paid people smugglers to turn back a boat full of people seeking asylum. The country's immigration minister, Peter Dutton, said that his government would honor its international commitments. "We will act within the law; we will act within our international obligations," he told reporters Sunday. However, migrant advocates have said that, should the allegations prove true, Australia is shirking its international obligations. "Clearly helping people smugglers is not something that is supported by international conventions," Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), told CNN's John Vause. "Indeed if they're traffickers by this point then that is something that would not be supported by anybody but we have to see what the facts are."  The United Nations refugee agency's report cited firsthand accounts of people on board a ship that was diverted to Indonesia after coming in contact with Australian authorities. The boat -- carrying 65 migrants from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar -- was intercepted by the Indonesian navy after turning back from Australia on May 31, the UNHCR said. The migrants were transferred to an Indonesian customs vessel for four days before being sent on two boats to Indonesia, the UNHCR added, after speaking to some of the passengers. Australia has refused to confirm or deny the payment, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott went on the defensive Friday when asked about the claim. Abbott refused to "comment on operational matters," but said that the government would stop the boats "by hook or by crook."  Along with Australian opposition politicians, Indonesia's foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, has demanded a response from the Abbott administration and said she had taken up the issue with Australia's ambassador to Jakarta. A ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir told Australia's ABC News that Indonesia would investigate the UNHCR allegations. "Of course on Australia's push-back policy we have been consistently saying they are on a slippery slope," ABC reported him as saying. "Should this situation (be) confirmed ... it would be a new low." Speaking with reporters Sunday, Abbott again avoided giving a direct answer as to whether Australia had paid people smugglers to turn boats around. "There's really only one thing to say here... and that is we have stopped the boats," CNN affiliate Sky News reported Abbott as saying. "That's good for Australia, it's good for Indonesia and it's particularly good for all of those who want to see a better world because if the boats start again, the deaths start again. None of us should want to see deaths at sea and the only way to ensure that the boats stay stopped. It's important that the Indonesians know that the Australian government is absolutely resolute in our determination never to see this evil trade start up again." Relations between Indonesia and Australia remain strained following the execution of two Australian nationals, part of the so-called Bali 9 group of drug smugglers, in April. Australia recalled its ambassador from Jakarta following the incident.  There are concerns that the plight of genuine refugees is being politicized by governments like Abbott's. "At the end of the day migration is a complex issue. It's often reduced to political slogans and it's certainly not something to be managed through sloganeering. We can't just lock the door on people," IOM's Doyle told CNN. "Around the world it's a phenomenon that needs collaboration and not simply closing the door on the problem."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho> A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's no accident that the first P8s were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and here it's watching China.</descricao>
            <corpo>Above the South China Sea (CNN)Take-off is swift on the U.S. Navy's P8-A Poseidon -- there's no slow roll down the runway on military flights -- and within minutes, the turquoise blue of the South China Sea comes into view from the window of America's most advanced surveillance and sub-hunting aircraft. The P8 crew, composed of more than a dozen naval aviators, invited me into the cockpit to watch and to listen. CNN last week first reported on this secret surveillance mission, which eight times received warnings from the Chinese navy to leave the contested area. This is a behind-the-scenes look at the journey. Approaching the P8-A Poseidon on the tarmac, it's easy to mistake the sophisticated aircraft for one of the many other Boeing 737 planes around it. The P8 is based on a 737 frame, but the similarities end there. Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Peeking out of the fuselage are numerous antennas, domes and camera wells, plus a bomb bay for sub-hunting torpedoes and spaces under the wings for Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Inside, the jet is home to an array of advanced intelligence-gathering equipment. I have the feeling of entering a CIA listening station in the sky. It's no accident that the first P8s -- only 18 months old -- were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and its principle mission here is keeping a watchful eye on China. Once we're aboard, we sit in on the flight crew's "delta briefing," the final briefing before takeoff. The aircraft's commander, Lt. Cmdr. Matt Simpson, lays out the mission plan. The P8 will leave from Clark Air Base in the Philippines and fly some 460 miles west to three reefs -- Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief -- which Beijing has rapidly been transforming into expansive islands and, the U.S. fears, soon-to-be permanent military stations 600 miles from China's coastline. From the air, the waters appear quiet and peaceful, but 60% of world trade traffics through here. And underneath the sea floor are believed to be enormous deposits of oil and gas. That helps explain the international free-for-all underway to claim an array of barely visible reefs and shoals. It's not only China but also the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei that are involved. Though the coastlines of the other countries are all closer than China's, they are still more than 200 miles away, far from their territorial waters, which by international law extend only 12 miles out from shore. America's own coastline is, of course, thousands of miles away, but the U.S. is still very much in the mix. It's the defender, in effect, of free passage through international waters for all international cargo ships and, crucially, the U.S. Navy. Forty-five minutes into the flight, the first mission target comes into view: Subi Reef. More than two dozen Chinese dredgers fill the lagoon, pumping sand from the ocean floor in huge plumes onto the surface, slowly and gradually building up an island from scratch. The scale and pace of their work is mesmerizing. In two years, China has expanded the surface area of reefs it claims in the South China Sea from just five acres to more than 2,000. The P8 crew expect the Chinese navy to warn them away as we approach. Usually these "challenges," as they refer to them, come once the jet is within a few miles, and indeed, the radio soon relays a voice speaking in Chinese-accented English: "This is the Chinese navy. This is the Chinese navy ... Please leave immediately to avoid misunderstanding." From both sides, the communication is calm and, mostly, professional. The American pilot quickly responds from a well-rehearsed script explaining that this is a U.S. aircraft operating in international airspace over international waters. U.S. threatens peace in South China Sea, Beijing says Still, as the Chinese navy radio operators come back on the line to repeat their warning, I can hear frustration building in their voices. In one case, the operator's voice grows louder and louder, ending in a high-pitched "You go!" The Chinese give warnings like this eight times during the flight. It turns out there are also civilian aircraft in the vicinity. A Delta Air Lines flight on that same frequency hears the Chinese challenge, and then pipes into the frequency to ask what's going on. The Chinese navy radio operator identifies himself, possibly to reassure them. The flight crew notes that this can be a very nerve-racking experience for civilian aircraft in the area. For now, these Chinese challenges are surface-to-air, coming from new early-warning radar stations they have positioned on the islands or from Chinese navy ships patrolling them. These reefs are too far from air bases in China for Chinese aircraft to intercept the P8 and start a potential confrontation in the air, but that may change if and when these islands have working airstrips. Fact is, China is already on its way. As we leave Subi Reef, we approach Fiery Cross Reef a few minutes travel away. Here China has made the most extensive progress. What used to be a rocky reef barely visible above the waves is now equipped with a nearly completed runway, a tower, an early warning radar station and barracks for Chinese soldiers and sailors. Meanwhile, Chinese dredgers continue to dig away at a deep-water harbor for Chinese ships. This is what some call China's "unsinkable aircraft carrier." If China continues to militarize the islands, as the U.S. fears, the three reefs will form strategic Chinese military bases right in the middle of some of the most contested waters in the world. On board the P8, the mood is calm and confident. These crews have been flying these flights for months now. But the more China builds, the U.S. sailors tell me, the more aggressively the Chinese navy is challenging them. CNN has learned that the U.S. is considering flying its aircraft -- and sailing its Navy warships -- even closer to the islands to further demonstrate that the U.S. does not recognize China's claims. The lowest we fly on this mission is 15,000 feet. But that could soon change. And what happens if China starts deploying its aircraft to these waters? The airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef is already long enough to accommodate every military aircraft in the Chinese arsenal. P8 flights hundreds of miles closer to the mainland are already intercepted by Chinese fighters. Last fall, in one such encounter, the Chinese pilot came dangerously close. The prospect of U.S.-Chinese collisions in the air are truly alarming, as past events have demonstrated. In 2001, a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. EP-3, the P8's predecessor, over Hainan Island, right off the Chinese mainland, leading to a major crisis as the damaged U.S. plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The P8 flight crew speaks confidently and calmly about their mission. But they know they are in the midst of a major and contentious potential conflict. Chinese protests are becoming more stern. U.S. surveillance flights and naval patrols are becoming more aggressive. And the two countries' positions are, for now, irreconcilable. China views these islands as its sovereign territory and describes its commitment to them as "unshakable." The U.S. views the area as international waters and airspace. Aboard the P8, it is difficult to see how those differences are resolved.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A group of armed insurgents attacked a police post in southern Afghanistan, killing 17 officers and wounding two others, an official said Saturday. The attack happened around 11 p.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Friday in the Musa Qala district of Helmand province, according to Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Zwak said investigators have been dispatched to the area to find out more about the incident, including how many insurgents, if any, died in the gunfight. Such violence, unfortunately, has plagued Afghanistan for years. Much of it has been spearheaded by the Taliban, the Islamist militant group forced out of power by the U.S.-led invasion following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks but still very much a disruptive force in the Asian nation. Many of the Taliban's targets have been police, troops and government workers. Still, it's not the only militant group to make claims: ISIS said it was behind the deaths of at least 33 people in Jalalabad, where a man on a motorbike blew himself up in front of a Kabul Bank branch. Still, while the latest attack in Helmand aligns with that history, it was not immediately clear who was behind it. This bloodshed has affected many parts of Afghanistan. Earlier this month, militants killed nine aid workers in an attack on a house in Afghanistan's northern Balkh province, according to Abdul Razaq Qaderi, chief of that province's criminal department. And in late May, four Taliban fighters were killed after launching an hours-long gun and grenade attack in an upscale district of central Kabul. No civilians or security forces died in that incident, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi told CNN. In Helmand province, a car bomb targeting the governor's compound killed at least seven people and wounded 46 in March, then-Deputy Governor Jan Rasoolyar said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said his group was responsible for that attack.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Why counterfeiting Western products has become such a popular job in Thailand.</descricao>
            <corpo>Bangkok, Thailand (CNN)On streets in Bangkok and in some of its glistening air-conditioned malls, countless counterfeit Rolexes, DVDs, Gucci fashion accessories and other products are openly on sale. Foreign tourists flock to Thailand's ubiquitous street markets, fascinated by the look and feel of the high-quality counterfeit goods openly on display and the cheap prices shouted out by touts. The ambiance of carefree shopping in public for such items make many tourists blasé about committing a crime they might never consider back home. They also see Thais eagerly purchasing the same items, lending an illusion of acceptability, even though everyone knows the goods are illegal and might get confiscated by international customs agents who often impose heavy fines. But who are Thailand's notorious counterfeiters? Armed gangsters, wealthy businessmen, savvy importers, enthusiastic housewives and thrill-seeking students are all profiting by illegally selling copyrighted items. Legal loopholes, the cost of investigations, fears of violence -- and the sheer quantity of fake goods -- enable them to publicly offer their wares with in-your-face sales pitches in English, Chinese and other tourist-friendly languages. People who want an expensive logo or style for a surprisingly cheap price enjoy shopping in Thailand despite American, European, Thai and other efforts to stop intellectual property right infringement.  "OK, this is a copy, not real, but no problem," a cheerful Thai woman says, pointing to a black knit polo shirt emblazoned with a Ferrari logo. "Why I have to worry from police? I am not selling drugs, I am not selling heroin. I don't steal this shirt from anybody," she says in the dilapidated maze of Bangkok's wholesale and retail Pratunam Market. "I pay police 30,000 baht ($940) every month or every two months," says a nearby seller of fake Rolexes and other top wristwatches. This cash allegedly goes to allow his stall to sell counterfeit wristwatches and avoid occasional crackdowns, though he's not in the mood to describe those precise benefits. His Pratunam stall conveniently displays an official Rolex catalog, to convince customers that his Rolexes look just like genuine ones -- but 10 times cheaper. Similarly, in nearby Patpong Road's tourist-thronged Night Market, a stall displays a fake Rolex Oyster Perpetual Submariner for less than $100. Various retailers sell the genuine item online for $6,500 and upward. "The real Rolex is made in Switzerland," the dealer says. "This one is made on a Japanese machine in Taiwan." In an air-conditioned mall several miles away, a sign deceptively advertises "Dr. Martens" next to boots resembling the real thing, but without any logos on the leather or soles. "The original Doctor Martens are more than 3,000 baht ($94) but these are only 999 baht ($31)," a young Thai man says. "Same design. Same material. This one is made in Thailand." MORE: Faking it at Bangkok's Museum of Counterfeit Goods  In Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket, Koh Samui, Chiang Mai and other tourist sites, these small-time vendors are often from Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal and other impoverished South Asian countries because they speak English and are considered expendable if police bust them. At the top of the counterfeit chain, however, knowledgeable men and women are using the same marketing and logistics techniques currently taught to MBA students, especially for sourcing imports. That's because during the past decade, tougher laws, professional training, corporate vigilance and tighter controls in Bangkok hit counterfeiters who secretly operated big sweatshop factories in Thailand. These became increasingly easy for investigators to find. As a result, much of the high-quality fake stuff is now imported from counterfeit producers in China, South Korea and Taiwan, according to vendors and counterfeiters in Bangkok's streets, when asked where most of their fake DVDs, upmarket designer handbags and wristwatches come from. The goods are routed overland through Laos and Cambodia to Bangkok, or shipped directly. "There aren't any more large facilities to produce counterfeit products in Thailand, but there tend to be more imports of counterfeit products into Thailand," says intellectual property lawyer Suebsiri Taweepon with the prestigious Tilleke &amp; Gibbins law firm. "Most are from mainland China. Some might be from Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos a little bit, but mostly they will originally come from China."  "I am working (with) top brands from all over the world, and every client asks us to go after the big fish, not the small player," says Suebsiri. But imports are now more common, compared to previous production-and-storage operators in Thailand, making the task difficult. "It is not that easy anymore to find the large warehouse [in Thailand] to store a large number of counterfeit products," Suebsiri says. Small-time vendors themselves often craft the simpler Thai-made fakes such as shirts, pants, shoes and other products that they can make themselves at home or in small buildings, sometimes by also hiring relatives and friends. "I think there are no actual top bosses in Thailand for making those products, because Thais are so good at producing clothing and it is quite easy to be produced as well," Suebsiri says. "They just change the way they use their skill for producing handicrafts, to producing counterfeit products."  Investigators who spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity say the most dangerous and feared dealers are suspected of having warehouses of imported counterfeit goods mostly hidden in Sa Kaeo province, along the Thai-Cambodian border, near the popular secondhand Rong Kluea market. (The private investigators ask to remain anonymous because they need to continue sleuthing around Sa Kaeo province and elsewhere, without being known to the counterfeiters or risking their personal safety.) Those items are produced in China and brought overland into Thailand from Cambodia. Experienced smugglers are protected from arrest, or competition by other counterfeiters encroaching on their market, because the smugglers are known to offer big wads of cash or threaten violence, according to investigators. Some wealthier, urbane, professional Thais illegally make their high-quality sophisticated items in plain sight, without hiding their factories. "This type of case could involve an ex-licensee, who got the license to produce the product under the brand owner's license in the past, but once the license expired, they continued to produce the products," Suebsiri says. "They have all the facilities, they have all the technique, they have all the materials." Their biggest profits often involve churning out famous-brand automobile accessories, medicine or other costly goods while ignoring the copyright or trademark owners.  In Thailand, there have been criminal cases involving people and companies whose original legal licenses have expired, but who continued to make automobile air bags for luxury European cars -- for export -- according to Suebsiri. Other wealthy counterfeiters invest thousands or millions of dollars to register the brand names of foreign companies in Bangkok -- before that company has done so -- in an effort to exploit the brand for as long as possible before being sued by the foreign owners, says Suebsiri. These high-end product counterfeiters tend to be extremely wealthy, and defend themselves in court proceedings with expensive legal teams. Unlike the border smugglers, they're not fearsome, armed gangs. "They are just normal guys. They have a big house, they have a luxury brand car. They claim to know officials. And many of them also have legitimate businesses," Suebsiri says. Other Thai counterfeiters aren't rich. They're middle- and lower-class people with enough street smarts to successfully hustle. "They could be a housewife who asks a factory to produce a number of shoes of a certain brand," Suebsiri says. "Or students who would like to make some money for having fun with their friends. They might [illegally] download the movies from several sources. "They just leave their computer on, to download things 24/7 everyday. "They might download e-books. They might scan comics, and make it as an e-book and sell it to others for a cheap price." Thailand's operators -- big and small -- also sell their imitations through Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, Line and other online social media. "The secret life of an intellectual property infringer or counterfeiter? There is no secret. It could be anyone," Suebsiri says.  Thailand's police and Customs Department seized more than 2.3 million counterfeit items and arrested 9,795 people in 2013, according to the latest statistics from the Commerce Ministry's Department of Intellectual Property (DIP). "The Department of Intellectual Property of Thailand plays a central role in promoting effective protection of intellectual property rights through keeping register of rights, development of legal infrastructure, public education and awareness campaigns to nurture a respect for IP rights and collaboration with law enforcement agencies particularly the Customs Department and the Royal Thai Police in fighting against manufacturing, importation and sales of counterfeit goods," DIP's director general, Malee Choklumlerd, said in a statement to CNN when asked about efforts to stop the fakes. "Fresh efforts have been made, such as the passage of amendments to the Money Laundering Prevention and Suppression Act ... which have added intellectual property infringements as a predicate money-laundering offense," she said. "The changes now provide a vitally important tool to address concerns, particularly with large-scale infringers and organized crime. The amended law includes the tool of freezing assets related to illegal production and trading of infringing goods," Malee said. Yet these efforts haven't satisfied some local critics. "The current military government, like those before it, is ignoring the increasing violations that endanger and damage the country and its citizens," warned a recent Bangkok Post editorial. "Counterfeit medicine is widely sold in containers almost identical to the original," it said. "Low-quality tires are fitted as high-end products, and sold to consumers unable to detect the difference." The U.S. government's annual "Review of Notorious Markets," issued on March 5 by President Obama's trade representative, said Thailand has a "large number of markets offering counterfeit and pirated goods and services, and a relative lack of enforcement." "Thailand remains on the Priority Watch List in 2015," the Office of the United States Trade Representative said in its April report focusing on the international protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). "The United States notes Thailand's stated desire to improve IPR protection and enforcement. At the same time, IPR enforcement does not seem to be a top priority for Thai law enforcement, and poor coordination among government entities has seen limited improvement despite the launch of the National IPR Center of Enforcement in 2013," it said. "The United States urges Thailand to do more to address longstanding organizational challenges to enforcement and to prioritize IPR enforcement."

            <corpo>(CNN)A U.S. woman's attempt to row solo from Japan to San Francisco was aborted just eight days into the journey due to bad weather. Sonya Baumstein, who has since returned to Japan safely, sent out a distress signal on Saturday about 155 miles off the coast of Japan. A freighter nearby picked her up before passing her on to a coast guard ship, the Japanese coast guard said. Baumstein set off from the port of Chosi, located east of Tokyo, on June 7 for the 6,000-mile journey, hoping to become the first woman to cross the Pacific alone. Baumstein's campaign manager, Andrew Cull, posted this statement on her website: "The past eight days have been interesting and we knew we were taking a chance with the weather and late season, concerned more about the weather upon arrival in California in the fall," wrote Cull. "After long conversations, loosing a drogue, a critical steering system failure, and battling headwinds and typhoons, Sonya made the decision to abandon this year's attempt. While we were only eight days in, the progress against wind and storms was slow and the next few weeks promised more storms and potentially even slower progress." The weather conditions also made it "impossible" for Baumstein to see other vessels near her, he wrote. Last Wednesday, Baumstein posted about her close run-in with a fishing boat. "All's well. After a hellacious first few days. Almost had a game ender with fish boat. Flare + Being prepared saved my life!" she texted via satellite. Baumstein has not made a decision on whether she will try again, her team said.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Four foreign hikers fined and released Friday after they took nude photos at a mountain considered sacred in Malaysia.  </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Four foreign hikers who posed naked on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia were freed Friday after they were fined and sentenced to time served. The backpackers -- from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands -- were arrested after stripping naked May 30 and posing for photos on the mountaintop, the nation's Bernama news agency reported. The mountain is considered sacred in Malaysia. They had pleaded guilty to "committing an obscene act." CNN has verified the identity of the two Canadians as Lindsey and Danielle Peterson. The Briton is named Eleanor Hawkins. The name of the Dutchman has not yet been confirmed by CNN.  The court in Kota Kinabalu on Friday evening fined the four 5,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $1,332, each and sentenced them to three days in prison. Taking into account the time served already, the court ordered them freed. Local residents had said their behavior caused the Kota Kinabalu earthquake this month, which killed 16 people. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists disrespected local culture and angered the spirit of the mountain, Bernama reported. Among those who appeared in court was a British citizen who was arrested at the airport this week as she was about to leave for the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The other three turned themselves in. They could have faced three months in prison.  It is not the first time tourists have made headlines for stripping off their clothes at major attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites this year. At least eight tourists were detained last year in separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century attraction in Peru.

            <descricao>The impact of Myanmar's repressive policy toward Rohingya Muslims was made clear in recent weeks with scenes of desperate people crammed into boats.</descricao>
            <corpo>David Scott Mathieson is the senior Burma researcher for Human Rights Watch. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)The impact of Myanmar's repressive policy toward Rohingya Muslims was made clear in recent weeks with scenes of desperate people crammed into boats, an escalation of a miserable maritime flight in which an estimated 90,000 people have fallen prey to smugglers and traffickers since early 2014. The United Nations estimates that around 1,000 people have died on the way. The root cause is the long-term reprehensible treatment of the Rohingya in Myanmar (also known as Burma) -- stateless, officially and socially reviled, with severe curbs on their rights to work, travel, get health care and education, and practice their religion. Yet even as this anguishing exodus has gripped international attention, it has obscured a connected and equally troubling pattern of rising religious extremism in Myanmar. At the height of the boat drama, parliament passed the "population control law," which permits the government to identify areas in Myanmar that could be subject to repressive birth control measures. The law was inspired by Buddhist extremists whose stated agenda is opposition not just to Rohingya, but to all of Myanmar's sizable Muslim minority. The law was sharply criticized by many activists in Myanmar and opposed by the opposition National League for Democracy, but passed a joint parliamentary vote, 530 to 443, with 39 abstentions. The population control law is one element of a package of four "race and religion protection" bills. The other elements are an interfaith marriage bill, which grants government oversight of any marriage between a Buddhist and non-Buddhist; a religious conversion law, which requires government permission to change one's religion; and a monogamy law, which could limit the rights of people living in unmarried relationships and potentially target Muslims. These laws were proposed by the increasingly influential Race and Religion Protection Association, known by its Burmese acronym, Ma Ba Tha, consisting of prominent Buddhist abbots. The problem is that Ma Ba Tha has tapped into a deep and divisive strain of ethnic Burmese ultranationalism and a belief in Buddhist religious supremacy that has contributed to vexed and violent relations with scores of ethnic minorities since independence from the British in 1948. U Wirathu, Myanmar's most vitriolic Buddhist monk, infuses his regular public rallies with populist paranoia over a nonexistent Islamic takeover of Myanmar. To push for passage of these discriminatory laws, the Ma Ba Tha staged public events throughout Myanmar and collected nearly 1.5 million signatures. The purportedly reformist government of President Thein Sein, pandering to Ma Ba Tha's agenda, then drafted similar pieces of legislation and submitted them to parliament. There are fears that the three remaining draft laws will pass in this final parliamentary sitting ahead of the first ostensibly free national elections in decades later this year -- and possibly fuel anti-Muslim violence during what will be a very tense period. After all, a surge of violence in 2012, which amounted to ethnic cleansing, displaced about 140,000 Rohingya, who languish in squalid camps. At the same time, security restrictions on the estimated 1 million Rohingya in areas abutting the Bangladeshi border have been tightened. Several incidents of anti-Muslim violence in the past two years have caused dozens of deaths. Myanmar's Rohingya: terrorized, starving and homeless Last month, local authorities and Thein Sein's office denied permission to hold a Union Muslims Nationwide Conference in Yangon, citing its potential for instability. On June 2, a court in upper Myanmar sentenced a writer and former National League for Democracy official to two years in jail with hard labor for "insulting religion," over a 2014 speech defending the purity of Buddhism from Ma Ba Tha's political distortion. Diplomats in the country realize that the race and religion laws could spark not only attacks on Muslims but justifications for government crackdowns. The United States, European Union and numerous United Nations officials have therefore conveyed their deep concern, although Burmese officials have rejected this out of hand. Meanwhile, many Muslims see the laws as just one part of a long-term plan to extirpate the Rohingya and other Muslims from the country, and there is a danger that all this could lead to the collapse of the nascent political reforms over the past four years that have led to the beginnings of economic development, increased international assistance and direct foreign investment that are crucial to help pull Myanmar from the hole dug by 50 years of dictatorial military rule. By mining the darker nature of Myanmar's Buddhists, religious extremists and the political opportunists who seek to profit from them are thwarting the aspirations of generations who have struggled for democracy and openness. Sadly, the extremism reflected in the laws suggests a future of even greater violence and division. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>A new book entitled Fashion China provides an introduction to 41 of the country's most exciting designers.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The obsession of Chinese luxury shoppers with Western brands is old news. Now, a new book entitled Fashion China is turning the spotlight on the top local brands vying for the international spotlight. Written by Irish fashion curator Gemma A. Williams, the book provides an introduction to 41 of the country's most exciting designers, from Fashion Fringe award-winner Haizhen Wang to couturier Laurence Xu. "We're creating a snapshot of what is going on over there," says Williams. "Designers play by their own rules, and it creates such an interesting dynamic." The author, who sports Alexander McQueen and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in her resume, was initially inspired by the growing number of Chinese international students she encountered while working at the London College of Fashion's Fashion Space Gallery in 2013.  To find the most interesting designers, Williams brought together a panel of Chinese experts, including Liu Wen -- widely considered the first Chinese supermodel -- and Karchun Leung, editor of Numéro China. "I'm going over with Western eyes and trying to understand the industry in terms of our systems, which has been the base for 100 years at least," she says. "Collaboration with [the panel] really opened my eyes to how unique the industry was." These differences include a unique design history and tradition, as well as a less strict adherence to the fashion calendar model that dominates in the West. (China has two major fashion weeks -- Beijing and Shanghai -- with irregular rosters, and many high profile designers show off-schedule or abroad.) "They helped me realize that the same criteria will never apply to the Chinese market. It's too large and it's too new, so they can set their own benchmarks."  By profiling a range of designers, Fashion China dispels common misconceptions and stereotypes about what Chinese fashion means. Designers like Guo Pei, who creates lavish, architectural couture gowns in Beijing, prove that 'Made in China' needn't mean shoddy quality; and the international buzz behind London-based newcomer Ryan Lo's colorful kitsch shows that Chinese design doesn't have to be traditional. But Williams thinks it could be a while before a Chinese designer becomes a household name abroad. Because of the diversity and breadth of their aesthetics, she doubts there will be a unified rise to prominence similar to that of avant garde Japanese designers like Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garçons creator Rei Kawakubo in the 1970's and 80's. "Chinese fashion is so varied and so disparate that it's very hard to pick out one or two aesthetics ... It's not like Japan, where they had a unified aesthetic that became a very strong look," she says. However, Williams hopes the book will encourage Westerners to shop outside their comfort zones, and recognize the value of work being done outside of the fashion capitals. "My main goal is to promote," she says. "It's really exciting that people are talking about these brands and finding out about them, and I hope [Fashion China] opens up the discourse around Chinese fashion." Fashion China is published by Thames &amp; Hudson.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Kim Jong Un watched two drills featuring what North Korean media called a new type of "anti-ship rockets," according to the country's newspaper Rodong Sinmun. The front page of the state newspaper featured pictures of a beaming Kim leaning back in a chair, surrounded by his smiling military cabal. Rodong Sinmun reported two drills -- one in daylight with anti-ship rockets and another one at night, testing both ground artillery and warships. The reports did not specify exactly where and exactly when the drills were held. The newspaper described the rockets as "highly intelligent" that detected and hit "enemy" warships in the drill. And it reported that Kim "appreciated their high concentrated firing" and apparently remarked that "shells seemed to have eyes." Earlier on Sunday, South Korean defense officials had reported the firing of three short-range anti-ship missiles from North Korea's eastern coast. South Korean officials had described the three missiles as KN-01 missiles. The KN-01 missiles are based on Soviet and Chinese technology with a range of 120 kilometers (74 miles), according to Globalsecurity.org. This isn't the first time North Korea has tested anti-ship rockets this year. Similar tests were conducted in February and again in May with proclamations made in North Korea's state media. On Monday, North Korea once again offered to hold talks with the South -- with conditions. But it seems unlikely that South Korea would accept the North's conditions, which includes ceasing all joint military exercises with the United States. Seoul and Washington have consistently dismissed those demands. CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Art Basel Hong Kong's eerily realistic nude sculpture  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>What kind of model could pose nude in a gallery 24-hours-a-day? Answer: The fake kind. Welcome to Art Basel, one of Hong Kong's biggest art fairs.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)A crowd of people jostle for a closer look at the naked woman crouching on her knees. Phones held aloft, the group shamelessly take pictures of her bare back and bottom -- safe in the knowledge she won't be waking up anytime soon. The remarkably life-like nude sculpture, created by Australian artist Sam Jinks, was by far the most photographed work at this year's Art Basel in Hong Kong, a three-day art fair that has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since it first launched nearly three years ago. A powerhouse brand in the art fair industry, Art Basel bought-out the homegrown Hong Kong International Art Fair in 2011, and quickly cemented the city's position in the multi-billion dollar global art market. This year's fair brought together 233 galleries from 37 countries and territories. Half of the galleries are from the Asian region, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. "It's a one-stop shop," is how Art Basel in Hong Kong director, Asia Adeline Ooi, describes the blockbuster show. "We have the best of Asia and the best of the rest of the world in the room." Just across from Jink's hyper-real nude model is Japanese art superstar Takashi Murakami's Kaikai KiKi booth, filled with statement works from the anime-inspired Superflat movement. Along with the hugely popular nude model, Jinks also created this sculpture from silicone, resin and human hair. Nearby is the booth for Hong Kong-based French dealer, Edouard Malingue, who shows established European names such as Laurent Grasso, alongside local up-and-comers -- most notably João Vasco Paiva, who displayed a nearly six-meter-tall sculpture resembling Styrofoam boxes typically found on the streets of Hong Kong. The emphasis on regional representation is what makes the fair stand out from its two counterparts, Art Basel in Basel, and Art Basel in Miami, and from the 180 other major international art fairs that take place throughout the year. While people from all walks of life come to ogle the art, and flocks of excitable school children are herded through, nattily dressed gallerists are quietly sealing million-dollar deals. A Chris Ofili painting titled "Dead Monkey - Sex, Money and Drugs," was sold for $2 million at David Zwirner's booth within the first hour of the fair's VIP preview on March 13. Art Basel in Hong Kong moved from its original May dates to March 15-17 this year, coinciding with the Hong Kong Arts Festival and the International Film Festival. The Hong Kong Tourism Board has dubbed March the "Hong Kong Arts Month." Art fervor has spilled beyond the art sector and even the city's shopping malls are filled with grand installations to coincide with the fair. It is also the first year of satellite art fair, Art Central, created by the same founders of the original Hong Kong International Art Fair and meant to complement Art Basel in Hong Kong. Chinese artist, Xu Longshen's painting, "Beholding the Mountain with Awe No.1," was presented by Hanart TZ Gallery. Collectors have been flooding into the city for the past week, including American actress Susan Sarandon, Swiss businessman Ulli Sigg, Britain's Tate galleries director Nicholas Serota, and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. "People are taking Hong Kong very seriously now. Some people say we've finally arrived," says Ooi. As Hong Kong matures as an art market hub and the hype over art fairs swell, more questions will be raised as to the future for local artists and the healthy growth of regional art producers. Sales made at global art fairs accounted for 40% of all dealer sales in 2014, or an estimated $10 billion, the second largest sales channel after in-gallery transactions, according to the European Fine Art Foundation. Briton Peter Liversidge's artwork, "Always," featured 447 light bulbs. "In a week like this past week, the art world has its eye on Hong Kong and it's great, but the real game change will be M+," says Hong Kong-based art consultant Alex Errera referring to the museum of modern and contemporary art and visual culture that is currently being constructed at the West Kowloon Cultural District. "It's easy to fall into the trap of having so many things happening in one week — everybody already knows that Hong Kong is a great place for business, it's more important that the attraction to the region can be sustained."

            <cabecalho>Why Singapore is putting its oil back into the ground - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The Jurong rock caverns in Singapore are taking the nations oil reserves deep underground -- the first of its kind in South-East Asia.</descricao>
            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)They're found 150 meters below the ground, taller than a nine-storey building and, once complete, will store 9 million barrels of oil. The Jurong rock caverns in Singapore are defying the challenge of limited land space by creating a deep underground storage facility for the city-state's oil reserves. This is the first project of its kind in South-East Asia, but it has been tried before to great success elsewhere in the world. "In Norway they use it for water treatment plans, in South Korea and Japan they use it for oil storage," says David Tan, Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the Technical &amp; Professional Services Group at JTC Corporation who are handling the industrial development in Singapore. After eight years in development, the first cavern opened in 2014, with four more in the pipeline. Once complete, the Jurong caverns will consist of an underground network of tunnels storing almost 1.5 million cubic meters of liquid hydrocarbons, such as crude oil.  The $700 million dollar venture -- just for phase one -- aims to help Singapore's petrochemical industry prosper by clearing 60 hectares of land above ground for further industrial use. "The 60 hectares of land can be used for about 6 petrochemical plants," says Tan. The petrochemical sector plays a key role in Singapore's $300 billion economy. But as the country has no natural resources to speak of, this income is not generated through oil itself, but through its processing and refinement. According to Singapore's Economic Development Board, the country hosts one of the world's top three export refining centers. The expansion provided by the Jurong rock caverns will make Singapore one of the largest chemical and energy hubs in Asia, helping to reach the nation's goal to double it's petrochemical production by 2030.  The ambitious caverns in Jurong bring with them a range of challenges that engineers need to control, the biggest one being the ingress of water. Water inside the walls of the cavern is inevitable -- and necessary --and prevents the stored oil from leeching out into the rock. But it's a fine balance between too much and not enough. "If too much water comes in, we have to grout the rock," says Tan whose organization strictly monitors the water coming in at all times.  "Singapore is small, so any land is important," says Jian Zhao, Professor of Geomechanics at Monash University, Australia. Zhao was previously at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore, where he worked on the planning behind the caverns. "Free land is a driving force," he says. But this is not the first time the country has gone underground. Aside from shopping malls and metro stations, the city-state's first deep underground facility was an underground ammunition facility by Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency -- opened in 2001. "We have good rock geologists in Singapore who can build caverns," says Zhao. "The idea is to make the city more liveable by putting everything undesirable underground." Zhao envisions a future where power stations, electrical stations, waste facilities, water treatment plants, warehouses, and data centres could be moved underground.  The Jurong rock caverns have already secured their first customer to ensure the underground space is used as intended. With four more on the way, the mindset behind Singapore's infrastructure is changing. "Underground, everything is much more stable," says Zhao, referring to factors such as temperature, humidity and vibration. Zhao believes more facilities can comfortably go underground. "We need to convince the public [that] underground space is nice and comfortable," he says. Changes in perception may be needed as JTC are now looking into heading downwards for spaces housing people -- rather than oil -- in the form of an underground science city. The facility could become a working environment for more than 4000 researchers. "[It's a] better environment for laboratories," says Zhao. Zhao further envisions going even deeper, to enable underground spaces with multiple levels. "We've looked at multi-layers already," he says. But he notes the need for extensive planning -- a strength of Singapore. "Planning is important...because underground spaces you can't remove afterwards," says Zhao. But as these visions are developed, their potential to become a reality will depend on the success of facilities such as the Jurong Caverns -- considered by Tan as a prototype for underground developments in Singapore. "A project like this will give us more confidence to carry out the next project underground," says Tan.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Could Hong Kong's fight for democracy be entering its final round? Six months after the end of the massive "Occupy" protests that paralyzed the city's streets last fall, another pivotal confrontation is brewing in the former British colony. It comes down to a Beijing-backed bill that could decide Hong Kong's future. Lawmakers begin debating the bill Wednesday. If it passes, the city will be able to vote for its own leaders -- as long as China approves the candidates. If it doesn't pass, Hong Kongers may never be able to vote for their leaders at all. It's a surprisingly complex story of a city struggling to transition from colonial to Chinese rule. How did we get here, and what's coming next? Our guide will get you up to speed.  Hong Kong is a small piece of land colonized by the British in 1841 and returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The majority of its 7 million people speak Cantonese, whereas most people in China speak Mandarin. Officially, Hong Kong is a Chinese "special administrative region", under a principle called "One Country, Two Systems." In practice, that means Hong Kong is a Chinese territory, but maintains its own currency, government, and laws: Websites like Facebook and Twitter aren't blocked here, residents can protest and criticize the government, and the press is not censored by law. This special status is set to expire in the year 2047.  It's about a deal that hasn't been fulfilled. When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years and eventually develop an election system based on universal suffrage. But nobody agrees on what that actually means. Read more: What is 'One Country, Two Systems'? Many Hong Kongers strongly believe the city is entitled to free and open elections -- an interpretation that local authorities, backed by Beijing, staunchly oppose. Years of negotiations have failed to yield an agreement. The conflict peaked dramatically last fall as pro-democracy Hong Kongers staged massive street occupations paralyzing key parts of the city in a bid to pressure authorities to make concessions. That movement, known as "Occupy Hong Kong" or the "Umbrella Movement," enjoyed popular support among Hong Kong's youth and drew headlines around the world. No matter: The government refused to budge, condemning the protests and eventually clearing the sites after 79 days. Watch more: What's next for Hong Kong's 'Generation Occupy'?  Chinese authorities have proposed what they say is a fair and final offer: Hong Kongers may vote for their next leader, as long as the candidates are narrowed down and approved by the Chinese government. A rolling poll of Hong Kongers shows views on the proposal are split down the middle -- nearly as many residents support it as oppose it. This week, the city's Legislative Council will vote on the proposal: The bill needs two-thirds of the chamber's support to become law. But just over one-third of the chamber is controlled by pro-democracy politicians, and they've sworn to veto the bill. It doesn't seem likely that the Chinese government's proposal will pass.  If Beijing's plan gets vetoed, the existing system for electing the city's leader will remain. That is, he or she will be chosen by a small committee that's stacked with Beijing loyalists. Here's the ominous part for the city's pro-democracy activists: Central authorities have warned this may be Hong Kong's last chance to have "democracy." If this proposal gets shot down, then there won't be a new proposal -- possibly ever, they say. However, the activists aren't buying it. They're determined to fight for "real universal suffrage" -- an election in which anyone can run and anyone can vote. They haven't given a clear explanation of how they plan to achieve this. But if the past is any indication, they'll continue to try a mix of negotiation, campaigning, and civil disobedience -- again, and again, and again.  The increasingly intense struggle for democracy has created a new era in Hong Kong's political climate. A generational gap has opened up between young people, who tend to support democratic reforms, and the older generation, who are comparatively more sympathetic to the establishment. Meanwhile, the share of Hong Kongers who identify as Chinese has dropped. Some ardently anti-mainland activists -- known as "localists" -- have grown more vocal since last fall's Occupy movement. A radical minority of them go as far as to advocate for an independent Hong Kong. Localists found themselves under scrutiny Monday after police arrested 10 people with suspected ties to "local radical groups" in an alleged bomb plot -- though pro-democracy activists have questioned the validity of the accusations. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are concerned about skyrocketing rents, increasing inequality, and diminishing press freedom. However, residents are divided over how much of these issues can be blamed on China's influence. That leads to the big question of what happens after 2047, when Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status expires. Will Hong Kong be allowed to retain control over its own affairs? Will it maintain its local character? Or will it become indistinguishable from other Chinese cities? Pro-democracy Hong Kongers are deeply skeptical that the Chinese Communist Party will loosen its grip. Rather, China's authoritarian influence over the city only seems to grow -- from their perspective, the days in which Hong Kong can enjoy its unique rights and freedoms are numbered.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Singapore is small, hot and heavily populated but also among the most liveable and economically successful cities in the word. How have they done it?
</descricao>
            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)Singapore is small, hot and heavily populated -- the 5.5 million residents of the tropical city-state live in less than 750 square kilometres of land. And population is expected to reach 6.9 million by 2030. Despite these challenges, Singapore continues to be amongst the most liveable and economically successful cities in the word, with a GDP equaling that of leading European countries. With more than 50% of the world's population living in cities already (a figure projected to reach 70% by 2050), Singapore -- where everyone is a city dweller -- is setting trends for rapidly urbanizing countries worldwide. But how have they done it?  Concept plans have been in place since 1971, with long-term visions and predictions for the design of Singapore's infrastructure. Such long-term planning was crucial as the population was growing much faster than originally anticipated. "The top priorities for Singapore as a newly independent state were to provide housing for its people and to create jobs," says Khoo Teng Chye, Executive Director of the Centre for Liveable Cities, Singapore. With limited land and no natural resources, there was always a focus on greenery, the environment and intensive development of utilities and infrastructure including power plants, deep-underground sewerage and refuse incineration. "Planning for clean air, clean water and green cover was integral to Singapore's city planning," says Khoo. Decentralization of commercial hubs was also key in the country's urban design to reduce congestion and commuting time -- improving liveability. "High density does not necessarily mean low liveability," says Khoo.  With high-density living comes high-density waste. But Singapore has been organized with its refuse management systems, not only by collecting it efficiently but even employing it to make more land. "They don't have the space to store waste," says Dirk Hebel, from the Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre for Global Environmental Sustainability. Waste is managed instead through regular incineration and the resulting ashes are combined with marine sand to extend Singapore's land mass. "They use ashes for landfill to extend the territory," says Hebel. In addition, the country has set a precedent for water resources through its desalination plants and NEWater plants, where sewage is filtered to recycle it into drinking water. But Hebel's group are now working on new avenues for using waste -- this time to construct buildings instead of land. "In Singapore you have almost 80% high-value resource waste," says Hebel. This category of waste includes plastics and glass, which could be re-purposed for building materials. Hebel's team recently exhibited the possibilities of waste recycling during the 2015 New York City Ideas Festival. They built an arched canopy pavilion comprised of waterproof panels made from discarded beverage containers. The canopy was anchored to a base composed of stacked, wooden pallets. Hebel sees future possibilities in Singapore: "There are things surrounding us that can be used in a secondary life as a building structure," he says.  Due to its close proximity to the equator, Singapore's climate is hot and humid, with temperatures averaging above 30 degrees Celsius and little variation throughout the year. The built-up nature of the city increases temperatures further through the 'heat island' effect -- caused by buildings blocking air flow, transport emissions and long-wave radiation heating up the island nation. As a result, a lot of the city's energy expenditure goes towards cooling people down. "Up to 60% of Singapore's electricity is for buildings," says Arno Schlüter, Professor of Architecture and building systems, also with the Future Cities Laboratory. Most buildings use electricity to cool-down and dehumidify public and work spaces. "Singapore is a noisy city due to all the [cooling] units on the wall," says Schlüter. To overcome this overconsumption of energy, Schlüter's team are now piloting a project with the United World College of South East Asia in which they are dehumidifying the air external to a building and flowing the resulting cool air over the façade of a building. According to FCL, "the technology consists of passive chilled beams, distributed ventilation units combined with an underfloor air distribution network and new control systems," and removed the need for air conditioning systems. "It means we can save a lot of space -- up to 1/3 of a building," says Schlüter. Designs for new buildings in Singapore now also regularly incorporate design for natural ventilation by capturing and promoting wind flow through a public space.  When population increases and demand for land spikes accordingly, the tendency is to build upwards -- as is the case for most cities worldwide. But with unique -- and more pressing -- land restrictions compared to the rest of the world, Singapore has now begun to build downwards and is taking workplaces underground. And they're going deep underground -- first with ammunition facilities, then the Jurong rock caverns storing oil in caverns deep below the ground and soon other industries, such as science laboratories. "[It's a] new way of using underground space on a larger scale," says Jian Zhao, Professor of Geomechanics at Monash University, Australia. Zhao was previously at Nanyang technical university in Singapore where he developed the first research proposals exploring the options to go underground. The design involves digging caverns into rocks more than 100 meters below the ground. "Underground, everything is much more stable," says Zhao referring to factors such as vibrations, temperature and humidity which are important for facilities such as power plants, water reservoirs and industrial settings in general. "The idea is to make the city more liveable by putting everything undesirable underground," he says.  The technological development of Singapore cannot be forgotten as this aspect of city living has long been incorporated into the design of the city-state. The Singapore mass rapid transit (MRT) is considered among the best public transport systems in the world -- needed due to restrictions on vehicle ownership -- and intelligent buildings have been in use for more than a decade aiding movement and entertainment through public and work spaces. But increasing density is putting more pressure on the country's infrastructure. "Singapore needs to adapt and innovate," says Khoo, in order to meet needs for residence, recreation and lifestyle. Innovation has been at the root of the country's development -- both for liveability and sustainability. "Technology is a key feature of green buildings," says Yvonne Soh, General Manager of the Singapore Green Buildings Council. "[It can] respond to the environment quickly and to people," she says. Responding to movements and uses of space in real-time can cut energy requirements dramatically. This emphasis on technology has helped Singapore become one of the Greenest cities in the world.  Singapore is now exporting its expertise in urban planning to other cities in Asia where rapid urbanization is taking place -- including the Tianjin Eco city, China and the new capital city in Andhra Pradesh, India -- paving the way for cities around the world. "Through greater collaboration among cities, mass urbanization -- the result of a rapidly growing global urban population -- will ultimately benefit the human race," says Khoo.  </corpo>

            <descricao>A North Korean soldier defects to South Korea across the heavily fortified border that separates the two countries, South Korean authorities say.</descricao>
            <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A North Korean soldier defected to South Korea on Monday across the heavily fortified border that separates the two countries, South Korean authorities said. The soldier crossed the Military Demarcation Line on foot from the eastern North Korean province of Gangwon, said a South Korean Defense Ministry official, who declined to be identified. Further details on the circumstances of the defection weren't immediately available. There was no reaction to the news on North Korean state media.  The border between North and South Korea is considered to be the most heavily militarized in the world. The two countries technically remain at war, because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armed truce and not a peace treaty. North Korean soldiers have occasionally made it across the highly sensitive zone in the past. In 2012, one managed to cross the border unnoticed and knock on the door of a South Korean barracks, embarrassing the South Korean military and prompting a public apology from the defense minister at the time for the security lapse. But defections directly across the border from North to South Korea are rare.  Most people attempt to flee the impoverished, oppressively ruled North by crossing the more open border into China and then trying to make their way to South Korea through other countries. More than 26,000 refugees from the North have reached the South since the end of the Korean War, according to the Unification Ministry in Seoul. The vast majority of them arrived during the past 15 years. But defection has become harder in recent years, the Unification Ministry says, and the number of people doing it has fallen significantly since Kim Jong Un succeeded his father as the North Korean leader.  Separately, North Korea on Monday said it was willing to hold talks with the South -- but with conditions attached. "If an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation is created between North and South Korea, there is no reason not to hold dialogue and negotiation between the two sides," a North Korean government statement carried by state media said. The conditions it set out included its often repeated call for South Korea to stop holding joint military exercises with the United States, a request that Seoul and Washington have consistently dismissed.  Pyongyang also told Seoul on Monday that it plans to release two South Korean citizens this week, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. North Korea said the two South Koreans -- a man in his late 50s with the surname Lee, and a woman in her early 50s with the surname Jin -- illegally entered North Korea on May 11. North Korea detained them the same month. The South Korean government said it believes the two went missing while traveling in China near the North Korean border. It expects to collect them Wednesday morning at Panmunjom, the "truce village" that straddles the border between the two Koreas. CNN's K.J. Kwon and journalist Jung-eun Kim reported from Seoul, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, was moved 3 centimeters (about 1.2 inches) southwest by the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that devastated Nepal in April, Chinese authorities say. But the April 25 quake, which left more than 8,000 people dead, did not affect the height of the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain, according to the report by China's National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation. Chinese state media reported the administration had set a satellite monitoring system on the peak in 2005 to observe the movement of the mountain. In the decade since, Everest had been moving northeast at a speed of 4 centimeters a year, and had grown by 0.3 centimeters annually, state media reported. The April earthquake reversed the direction of the mountain, shifting it to roughly where it would have been nine months earlier. Nepal reopens 7 historic sites after quakes It triggered a number of avalanches on and around the mountain -- which is at the border of Nepal and China -- claiming the lives of many climbers. The deaths led mountaineering companies to call off their climbs for the rest of the season. Heroes' dreams 'scattered' by quake New data showed a second deadly quake in Nepal, which struck on May 12 with a magnitude of 7.5, did not move the mountain, state media reported. Previous analyses by seismologists have said that the mountain probably shifted by as much as meters in the quake, but the height was probably unchanged.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The international charity Save the Children says that its office in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, has been closed by national authorities without notice. But Pakistani authorities on Friday issued a statement saying that several nongovernmental organizations were working against the country's national interests and would not be allowed to continue their work. Save the Children said it has been working in Pakistan for more than 35 years and had a staff of 1,200 people in the country, none of them expatriates. "On June 11, Save the Children confirmed that its office in Islamabad, Pakistan, had been closed and sealed off today by the Pakistani authorities," the international organization said in a Thursday statement. "Save the Children was not served any notice to this effect. We strongly object to this action and are raising our serious concerns at the highest levels."  The government statement Friday, quoting Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan, said the organizations in question "are operating with support from the United States, Israel and India." The minister said he planned to raise his concerns in parliament. The statement from the ministry said the government does not plan to ban all NGOs but is working on a plan to regulate and facilitate "legal" ones. Save the Children said that last year that its health, education, food security and other programs in the country reached more than 4 million children and their families. The organization said that all its work was "designed and delivered in close collaboration with the government ministries across the country, and aims to strengthen public service delivery systems in health, nutrition, education and child welfare."

            <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)South Korean officials announced one more death in the country's MERS outbreak Wednesday, raising the total death toll to 20. Eight new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were also announced, bringing the total number to 162 -- 18 of whom are in an "unstable" condition, according to South Korea's Ministry of Health. The number of people under quarantine in South Korea, both in their own homes or in quarantine facilities, rose by 922 from Tuesday to 6,508. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the number of new cases "appears to be declining" -- indicating that the outbreak could be slowing down. But it also warned that "all outbreaks are unpredictable." "This is especially true for a comparatively new disease like MERS" where many facets of the virus are not well understood, the WHO said. Earlier this week, there had been a sign of a possible return to normalcy, as thousands of schools across South Korea re-opened after closures due to the deadly outbreak. But it came with heightened awareness; children's temperatures were monitored in classrooms and teachers warned students to practice personal hygiene and frequently wash their hands. Not all schools have reopened; 440 remain shut as officials seek to stop the spread of MERS. The WHO had recommended re-opening institutions last week because transmission of the virus had not been linked to schools. The MERS outbreak remains largely confined to health care settings. Should you be worried about MERS?  The outbreak has sparked international concern, stalled the nation's economy and resulted in over 100,000 canceled tourist visits to the country. Korea's department store sales tumbled 16.5% compared with the same period last year and retail shops also decreased 3.4%, according to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The ongoing situation has put Korean authorities under scrutiny for their inability to contain MERS cases and President Park Geun-hye has seen her approval ratings plummet. In a news conference Monday, the Ministry of Health announced that a special task force had been sent to South Korea's second largest city, Busan, after learning that one of the most recently diagnosed MERS patient had visited several hospitals and clinics in the area. "We are doing our best to stop the spread of MERS," said the Korean minister of health. "We are analyzing the CCTV with the help of Busan police," referring to tracking down who had been at the hospitals.  Researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and China's Fudan University have been working on an antibody treatment that could fight MERS. An antibody is a protein that combats pathogens like viruses and bacteria. The antibody treatment has only been through lab and animal tests so far and requires trials on humans before it could be available to MERS patients. While the antibody, named m336, has been effective in animals, it has yet to be tested on MERS patients, said Professor Jiang Shibo from Fudan University. All U.S. drugs are required to have human trials, as there are treatments that work in animals but turn out to be ineffective in people. The human trial process could take three to four years, but experimental treatments can be used if patients and the local government consent. So far, m336 has been considered the most potent of several antibodies that could be used to fight MERS, according to a scientific summary published in the Journals Center for Cancer Research.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has recorded five cases of MERS in the past week, the official state-run Saudi press agency said Sunday, citing a weekly Ministry of Health statement. It included one death of a 73-year-old man who died in the city of Turaba and had a pre-existing condition. The strain of coronavirus that causes MERS was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. The man believed to be "patient zero" in the current outbreak in South Korea visited Saudi Arabia in May, along with three other Middle Eastern countries. That 68-year-old patient went from facility-to-facility near or around Seoul before getting properly diagnosed. It triggered the hospital-based transmission of MERS in South Korea. The South Korean outbreak is the largest outside of Saudi Arabia -- over 5,000 people remain in quarantine.  In Seoul, Samsung Medical Center -- one of the city's hospitals that has counted many of the nation's MERS cases among its patients and visitors -- announced Sunday that it will suspend all surgical procedures except for emergency surgery "to fully focus on responding to MERS." More than 50 confirmed MERS cases have been traced back to the medical center, according to the center's website. The medical center, located in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district and considered one of the most prominent hospitals in the capital, issued an apology for its handling of MERS. "We sincerely apologize with our heads bent to the people for causing great concern as Samsung Medical Center became the center (of) the spread of MERS," hospital President Song Jae-hoon said. 5 things to know about MERS CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul. Journalists Evonne Liu and Han Sol, and CNN's Kay Guerrero, Kathy Novak and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>China: Young people seek out no-frills weddings - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>With the average Chinese wedding now costing $20,000, some couples are looking for cheaper alternatives. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Shiny rings, white gowns and luxury cars filled the mammoth national convention center, next to the Chinese capital's Olympic Bird's Nest stadium, one recent weekend. Armed with balloons, teddy bears and goody bags filled with coupons, throngs of salespeople stood outside their booths, shoving free gifts into the hands of visitors in an attempt to turn them into clients. Spread across two floors, more than 200 vendors competed at Beijing's Olympic-sized wedding expo for the attention -- and, more importantly, the wallets -- of thousands of young couples. PHOTOS: Tibetan couple's unconventional wedding pictures go viral  Everything was on sale at a discount, but even a rough calculation on site pointed to the soaring cost of getting married in China. The total bill could easily exceed $20,000 -- an unimaginable sum just a few years ago -- counting a pair of rings, a bridal gown, a banquet, a photo shoot and a professional planner. In the United States, the average cost of a wedding -- excluding a honeymoon -- has a similar price tag of $25,200, according to the latest figure released by the Wedding Report, a market research firm. Although rapid economic growth has brought rising incomes, the average Chinese still makes only a fraction of their American counterpart. Government statistics show the annual disposable income for 2014 was only $3,283 per person in China. The ballooning cost of weddings has spurred a multi-billion-dollar industry, but also put a heavy burden on the more than 10 million couples marrying every year in the world's most populous nation, especially those who already feel financially strained trying to buy their first home and car. READ: How to get ahead on China's dating scene Faced with a deep-rooted cultural preference for marriage, however, young Chinese preparing to tie the knot admit that cutting back is not always an option. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime event -- so I have to show my commitment to her and her parents through the wedding," explained Wang Di, 23, who was looking for good deals at the expo even though he and his girlfriend don't plan to walk down the aisle for another two years. "We may not care that much about the ceremony -- but the parents and other relatives do."  Frustrated with family pressure, some rebellious Chinese couples have chosen to enter so-called "naked marriages" with no houses, no cars, no weddings -- and sometimes no rings. While the public seems to appreciate the philosophy of true love trumping everything else, most respondents in repeated surveys still reject the notion of disavowing all traditional trappings of marriage. Increasingly, though, less radical -- but more creative and affordable -- ideas are gaining popularity in big cities. At a courtyard house in suburban Beijing one recent Saturday, the dress code was casual, but everyone appeared to be having some serious fun at the bride and groom's "do-it-yourself" wedding. On stage, the bride had already kicked off her high-heels. The venue was the couple's home -- rented for only $2,500 a year from a local farmer. The decoration that emphasized fresh flowers and entertainment -- featuring a DJ and a band -- were both courtesy of their artistic friends. Adorning the brick walls were various home-made movie-style posters starring the bride and groom, including one showing them laughing in bed with the phrase "mad love" in bold yellow lettering splashed across the red duvet covering their bodies. READ: Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market  "Almost every wedding now goes through the same drill and I don't want that," said bride Zhang Yueyue, a marketing manager at an arts magazine. "I think letting everyone have fun is the most important thing. Many Chinese weddings now are more about flaunting wealth and letting parents have 'face' through extravagance." Counting catering and tailor-made traditional Chinese dresses, Zhang and her artist husband spent less than $2,000 on their big day. With their modest incomes, the newlyweds agreed that saving from the wedding meant more money to start their married life together. Amid loud cheers and applause in the courtyard, some of the couple's guests already felt inspired. "My budget won't be high either," said Zhao Mengsha, a colleague and friend of the bride who is planning her own summer wedding. "I just want a big party with some entertainment -- and most importantly lots of alcohol." That definitely sounds like a winning formula for a special occasion.

            <descricao>Iranian nuclear negotiations are getting increasingly difficult and the deadline for a deal may need to be extended, officials said Friday.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)Iranian nuclear negotiations are getting increasingly difficult as diplomats stare down a fast-approaching deadline at the end of the month -- a deadline officials said may need to be extended. A senior U.S. official and Western diplomat downplayed a report from the Russian news agency Tass, which quoted a diplomat as saying talks are "virtually stalled." The two officials instead told CNN Friday that negotiations are tough, as expected, but continue to move forward. But the two sources said that the talks are at a delicate moment and that negotiations may have to be extended a few days past the June 30 deadline. Nobody in the room is yet talking about a full-scale extension, they added. The United States and five other world powers are negotiating with Iran to curb the country's nuclear program and keep it from building a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful, and in April the parties reached a framework to hash out the details of a final deal. Sanctions relief for Iran and the level of access inspectors will have in that country continue to be major sticking points in the negotiations. Iran wants near immediate sanctions relief, while Western officials are wary of lifting sanctions too quickly as they keep an eye on Iran's activities in the early months after a deal is reached. Western diplomats are also pushing for unprecedented levels of access that would allow international inspectors to visit any facility in Iran suspected of nuclear activity, including military sites. Tehran has strongly pushed back on that level of access, looking to keep military sites off limits. World powers also want Iran to come clean about any past efforts to develop a military dimension to its nuclear program. Although it seems unlikely that that issue will be fully resolved before any deal is reached, U.S. officials and European diplomats insist sanctions relief will be tied to Iran satisfying lingering questions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog. One incentive the sides have to reach an agreement by the deadline or shortly thereafter: An extremely skeptical Congress will have 30 days to review a final nuclear deal with Iran -- a period that will be doubled if a deal isn't reached by July 9.  </corpo>

            <descricao>On the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. Shereen El Feki says that needs to change.</descricao>
            <corpo>Shereen El Feki is the author of "Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World," a study of changing sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET. Cairo, Egypt (CNN)In a packed Cairo theater a couple of months ago, Ali Qandil brought down the house. "Why do Egyptian fathers cry at their daughters' weddings?" the comedian asked the crowd. "Because they know their little girls will be having sex for the first time." In Egypt's current conservative climate, Qadil's well-aimed thrust at sexual taboos was enough to send the audience into stitches, even as the theater management reached for its smelling salts. The show was courtesy of Al-Hubb Thaqafa ("Love is Culture"), a groundbreaking social media platform offering straight talk on love, sex and relationships in Arabic. Launched just over a year ago, its website, YouTube channel and social feeds have attracted more than nine million visitors, mainly from Egypt and Morocco. Al-Hubb Thaqafa's no-nonsense approach to sex, offering accurate information on everything from the basic facts of life to the finer points of fellatio, is a welcome development in a region where teachers are often too embarrassed to communicate even the barebones sexual and reproductive curriculum on offer, and parents generally draw a veil of silence over such topics with their kids. For Ali Qandil, sex is an endless source of humor -- just as it is anywhere else in the world. But on the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. In recent weeks, accounts of the arrest and abuse of dozens of gay men and transsexual women in Egypt, or mass sexual exploitation under ISIS' reign of terror, or Morocco's recent ban on a new film which lays bare the country's thriving sex trade, do little to dispel the image of societies mired in sexual repression. But by emphasizing sex as a pleasure to be enjoyed, rather than a problem to be solved, Al-Hubb Thaqafa hearkens to a long tradition of free and frank exchange on sexual matters in Arabic. Short of cybersex and internet porn, there isn't much its platforms tackle that our forefathers from weren't writing about more than a millennium ago. READ MORE: 13 signs you're probably in Cairo There is nothing un-Islamic about talking about sex; indeed, many of the great works of Arabic erotica were written by religious scholars. But over the centuries, and in particular in recent decades with rise of Islamic fundamentalism, societies across the Arab region have become far less comfortable in their sexual skin. Al-Hubb Thaqafa offers a chance (in part by reclaiming Arabic as a language of sexuality and offering a "respectable" alternative to street slang) for men and women to talk each other about sex -- asking questions, sharing personal experiences and contesting each other's opinions without the usual embarrassment or censure. Such opportunities are all too rare offline. It's been two years since I published "Sex and the Citadel" -- a five-year investigation into sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region, and their intersection with politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations. Since then, the grand political aspirations which fed the Arab Spring have either frosted over, as in Egypt, or burnt up in the conflagration now consuming Libya, Yemen and Syria. Sex might seem an odd focus these days, given all the other pressing issues in the region. But it is never far from politics, as authoritarian powers -- be they military-backed presidents or religious extremists -- know only too well, using matters of flesh, wrapped in selective interpretations of Islam, to clamp down on their communities. This is sadly true beyond the borders of the Middle East as well. But the converse also holds. Realizing the rallying cries of the recent uprisings -- "freedom", "justice" and "dignity" -- in private life will, in the long run, have profound implications for public life as well. When it comes to sex, it is never black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In this, as with so many other aspects of life, there are at least 50 shades of gray. On my travels, I've met men and women across the Arab region who are exploring that spectrum. Doctors like Chafik Chraibi, a Moroccan obstetrician whose efforts to open up his country's restrictive abortion laws have helped to catalyze a recent small step in legal reform. Educators like Safa Tamish, a Palestinian living in Israel, who is working to get sex education into schools and families across the West Bank. Or activists like the founders of Chouf and Damj, two new Tunisian NGOS, which are among the dozens of groups across the region trying to find a place for men and women whose sexualities or gender identities break the mold. There are many, many more such initiatives -- combating sexual violence, or securing the rights of unwed mothers or providing sexual health services to unmarried youth, for example -- springing up across the Middle East, often on very rocky ground. The most successful work slowly, along the grain of religion and culture. Confrontation -- be it political protests in Tahrir Square or Femen-style baring of breasts -- is not the way to achieve tangible, durable change in the Arab region, as recent events have clearly demonstrated. For too many -- particularly women -- sex is still bound up in shame, which makes it a powerful tool of political and social control. Sexual freedoms are hard to exercise when family interests trump individual choice, or when appearance counts for more than reality -- when virginity is defined by a piece of anatomy -- an intact hymen -- rather than a state of chastity, or when prostitution masquerades as marriage between wealthy visitors and desperate refugees. Shifting the political, economic and social conditions which underpin these realities is the work of a generation at least. But at least in a few places, positive change is slowly taking root. As my Egyptian grandmother used to say, "If there were seeds for patience, I would have planted fields." In other words, what we need is a sexual evolution, not revolution. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET. </corpo>

            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)A court in Egypt upheld a death sentence Tuesday against former President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, 63, was sentenced to death last month for his role in a 2011 prison break. Morsy, along with 16 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders, was also given a life sentence for espionage. Life in Egypt means 25 years. Three more senior members of the organization -- Khairat Al Shater, Mohamed Beltagy and Ahmed Abdel Alaty -- were sentenced to death by hanging. The political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the decision "politicized" and the charges "fabricated." "President Morsy's trial has fallen far below the most basic international legal standards," a statement from the Muslim Brotherhood said. "Today's announcement is another nail in the coffin for democracy in Egypt." It called on the international community to stop what it called the "cruel dictatorship" of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The military ousted Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, in 2013.

            <cabecalho>Al-Wuhayshi's death deprives al Qaeda of a heavyweight - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Nasir al-Wuhayshi didn't fit the stereotype of a terrorist leader. But he also had an understated charisma and inspired awe and deep loyalty among fighters</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Nasir al-Wuhayshi didn't fit the stereotype of a terrorist leader: He was slight, quiet and had an impish sense of humor, according to one of the few Westerners to have met him. But he also had an understated charisma and inspired awe and deep loyalty among al Qaeda fighters in Yemen. Even though he was only in his late 30s, al-Wuhayshi had more than 20 years of experience fighting jihad and had been close to Osama bin Laden. To many observers, his death is the most significant individual blow to al Qaeda since the killing of militant preacher Anwar al-Awlaki (also in Yemen) four years ago. Morten Storm, a Danish informant for Western intelligence who got access to al-Wuhayshi early in 2012, describes him as "one of the last al Qaeda heavyweights, a fighter's fighter." Al-Wuhayshi had fashioned al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, into the only affiliate capable of both taking territory on its home turf and planning sophisticated attacks overseas. The "underpants" bomb designed to bring down a U.S. airliner over Detroit, the plot to blow up planes with printer bombs (which very nearly succeeded), a complex attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen, the Paris attack on Charlie Hebdo this year: They and many other conspiracies were hatched by AQAP from its redoubt in Yemen's mountainous southeast. To his admirers, al-Wuhayshi also seemed untouchable. Once bin Laden's personal secretary in Afghanistan, he returned to Yemen and was jailed -- only to escape in a massive breakout of al Qaeda prisoners in 2006. Under his leadership, al Qaeda in Yemen soon became al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and attracted Saudi recruits -- some of them former detainees at Guantanamo Bay. There were rumors that al-Wuhayshi was killed in a U.S. missile strike in December 2009, but he soon resurfaced. He was also seen as the brains behind an ambitious plan to attack U.S. diplomatic missions in 2013 -- one that led to the temporary closure of some 20 U.S. embassies. Al-Wuhayshi contributed to this aura with a brazenly open appearance in front of dozens of jihadists in a video released last year. Apparently oblivious to the danger of a missile strike, he tells the group: "We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!" Despite opportunities at home, AQAP was still very much focused on distant enemies. The United States recognized al-Wuhayshi's significance in declaring him a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist" in 2010, offering a reward of $10 million for information on his whereabouts.  At a time when al Qaeda is being challenged across the Middle East by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, al-Wuhayshi was a totemic figure as leader of the group's most effective and resilient affiliate. ISIS may have become the destination of choice for a new generation of militants, but al-Wuhayshi rejected it unequivocally, swearing a personal oath, or bayat, of allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and being appointed the group's second in command globally. In statements late last year, AQAP criticized ISIS for distributing videos of beheadings. And one of its leading ideologues, Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari, complained that "our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate (and) they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries where they have no governance," Yemen no doubt included. Al Qaeda's second in command killed in Yemen strike; successor named Even so, one very influential Yemeni cleric has been calling on AQAP to pledge its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And ISIS has continued to establish its presence in Yemen undaunted, with massive suicide bombings of Houthi gatherings in the capital last year and further attacks against Houthi forces since. Its numbers may be in the dozens there, compared with AQAP's in the many hundreds -- according to Yemeni officials -- but it has made its mark.  If al-Zawahiri is the figurehead, a distant chairman of the board, al-Wuhayshi was the dynamic chief executive officer. Not that his death will lead to AQAP's liquidation. Among al Qaeda groups -- and despite successful drone attacks against several of its leading figures -- AQAP has considerable stamina. Even so, al-Wuhayshi's demise deprives the group of the leading light in a tight nucleus that has run the organization since its inception, a cohort that according to a study of AQAP by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point "avoided the strategic mistakes that commonly defeat jihadists elsewhere, keeping AQAP relevant in a highly competitive domestic and international environment." One of the few left in that cohort is now al-Wuhayshi's successor: military commander Qasim al-Raymi, considered the operational brains of the franchise. He has probably been involved in every major decision of the last decade, but is only 37. Like al-Wuhayshi, he was also designated by the U.S. in 2010, with a reward of $5 million attached. Al-Raymi comes from an area near Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. He escaped jail with al-Wuhayshi nine years ago and was planning sabotage attacks against oil installations within months. Some Saudi officials see him as more dangerous than al-Wuhayshi in terms of his ability to plan attacks. He is thought to have conceived the plan to assassinate then-head of Saudi intelligence Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, in 2009. Al Qaeda's chief bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, engineered the device, which was inserted into his brother's rectum but failed to kill bin Nayef. Al-Raymi is important for another reason: He is Yemeni, in a group that includes Saudis and other foreigners. "Removing this top tier of Yemenis while leaving the group's foreign leaders in place would be a catastrophic loss for the group, in effect stripping it of the local credibility and strategic guidance essential to endure in Yemen," concludes the Combating Terrorism Center. Opinion: A death trap for al Qaeda leaders? Most counterterrorism analysts expect al-Raymi to keep AQAP in the al Qaeda fold, but whether he will have the ability to dent ISIS' budding appeal in Yemen is an open question. He does not have links to "AQ Central" as deep as al-Wuhayshi's, but he was also in al Qaeda's Afghan camps as a teenager in the 1990s. Al-Raymi -- like his predecessor -- sees the war in Yemen as part of "America's broader war against Islam, one in which the United States used Muslim forces to advance its objectives in Iraq, Pakistan and Palestine," according to the Combating Terrorism Center report. He has been excoriating about the drone campaign's effect on Yemen's civilian population. One tidbit on al-Raymi: He may have a blond Croatian wife. In 2009, Morten Storm, an informant for Western intelligence, found and introduced by video a young woman called Irena Horak to al-Awlaki. The cleric was then living in a remote area of Marib province and apparently was desperate for a Western wife. Horak renamed herself Aminah, flew to Yemen and married him. When al-Awlaki was killed, Western intelligence officials told Storm that Aminah may have become al-Raymi's wife. There was even a plan to track down al-Raymi by sending a bugged makeup box to Aminah.  AQAP's fortunes will in great part depend on whether Yemen as a state falls into the abyss or is somehow patched back together thanks to international mediation. The group has flourished since the Houthi takeover of the capital and other parts of central Yemen. As a Shia sect, the Houthis inspire loathing among militant Sunnis, a useful recruiting tool for AQAP. For a while in 2013 and 2014, AQAP was forced onto its back foot as a reorganized Yemeni military, supported by U.S. intelligence and drone warfare, went on the offensive. But the chaos of the last nine months has allowed al Qaeda to re-establish itself in provinces like Shabwa and Hadramaut in the south. It is now one of several actors -- the Houthis, loyalists to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, southern secessionists, the Saudis -- in a complex battlefield of shifting alliances. AQAP has enjoyed the ungoverned space provided by Yemen's implosion, essentially taking over towns like the port of Mukalla in the south while retaining hideouts used by bomb-maker al-Asiri and his apprentices. It has benefited from another mass prison break and the withdrawal of U.S. Special Forces from a base in eastern Yemen. But al-Wuhayshi's death -- along with drone strikes against several other AQAP figures in recent months -- shows that the U.S. retains reach and intelligence in Yemen. And to some analysts, al-Raymi and al-Asiri are the last surviving "big" players in AQAP. So al-Raymi inherits a mantle where risk and opportunity are in almost equal measure. But he certainly knows the territory. Bergen: Will whack-a-mole strategy succeed vs. terrorists?

            <corpo>(CNN)Al Qaeda's second in command, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, has been killed in a drone strike in Yemen, dealing a heavy setback to the leadership of the international terrorist group. Al-Wuhayshi was the top leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, one of the most dangerous and dynamic branches of the jihadist network. His death is "the biggest blow against al Qaeda since the death of (Osama) bin Laden," said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Al-Wuhayshi was al Qaeda's "leading light" and was one day expected to take over from its current global chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri, said Cruickshank. Two Yemeni security officials told CNN on Monday that al-Wuhayshi was killed Friday in a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen's Hadhramaut region. On Tuesday, AQAP released a video statement announcing that its leader and two aides had died. The speaker said that al-Wuhayshi would be succeeded by the group's military chief, Qasm al-Rimi, also known as Abu Hureira al-Sanaani. Opinion: A death trap for al Qaeda leaders?  The U.S. government confirmed al-Wuhayshi's fate Tuesday, calling his death "a major blow to (al Qaeda's) most dangerous affiliate and to al Qaeda more broadly." Al-Wuhayshi "was responsible for the deaths of innocent Yemenis and Westerners, including Americans," U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said. "While AQAP, al Qaeda and their affiliates will remain persistent in their efforts to threaten the United States, our partners and our interests, (al-Wuhayshi's) death removes from the battlefield an experienced terrorist leader and brings us closer to degrading and ultimately defeating those groups." Al-Wuhayshi, known as al Qaeda's crown prince, was a charismatic figure who was adored by many of the terrorist group's jihadist fighters. In a video that surfaced in April of last year, al-Wuhayshi appeared brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen, the impoverished nation that the organization uses as a base. In a speech to the group, he makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying: "We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!" The video showed what looked like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. Al-Wuhayshi's death deprives al Qaeda of a dynamic heavyweight  Originally from Yemen, al-Wuhayshi assumed command of AQAP in 2009. He'd escaped a Yemeni prison in 2006 and had previously worked as a personal secretary for Osama bin Laden. His successor is also seen as a formidable leader. "Qasm al-Rimi was considered the brains of the operation," Cruickshank said. "For more than a decade, he's really been at the helm of the military side of things for AQAP but also planning their large international operations." The leadership change is expected to bring "a degree of continuity," he said, noting that al-Wuhayshi and al-Rimi were believed to have worked very closely together. April: American mouthpiece for al Qaeda killed  Al-Wuhayshi's death comes at a time when AQAP appears to have been thriving amid the recent turmoil in Yemen. The group has been "expanding the territory they control, taking advantage of political chaos," Cruickshank said. AQAP has been feeding off anger among Sunni tribes in Yemen over the advances made by the predominantly Shiite Houthi rebels who overthrew the Yemeni government earlier this year. Adding to the violence and destruction, a Saudi-led coalition has been bombing the Houthis and their allies in an effort to restore the deposed government. AQAP has exploited the unrest to seize more turf, including the port city of Al Mukalla, where it freed hundreds of inmates from a prison in April. The Yemeni security officials told CNN that the drone strike that killed al-Wuhayshi took place in southern Al Mukalla. What is AQAP?  Yemen's descent into chaos prompted the United States to pull out its Special Operations forces based in the country in March, raising fears that its counterterrorism efforts against AQAP would be hobbled. But al-Wuhayshi's death and an airstrike in April that killed a senior AQAP leader show that Yemen is no haven for the terrorist group. U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, told CNN on Monday that the terrorist leader's death would hurt al Qaeda, but he stressed that the jihadist network still poses a threat. "This is a long, difficult struggle that we're engaged in, and it's going to require all kinds of tools," he said. News of al-Wuhayshi's death emerged days after U.S. planes carried out a strike inside Libya, purportedly killing a key terror figure in North Africa. The target was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran Islamist fighter who is blind in one eye and affiliated with al Qaeda in North Africa, a U.S. official told CNN. The Libyan government said Belmokhtar was killed in the weekend strike, something that U.S. officials have not confirmed. Senior AQAP leader Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi killed CNN's Dana Ford, Hamdi Alkhshali, Salim Essad, Merieme Arif, Barbara Starr, Greg Botelho, Jomana Karadsheh and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>A death trap for al Qaeda leaders? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Since AQAP seized a Yemeni port in April, four of its leaders have been reported killed in drone strikes.</descricao>
            <corpo>David Sterman is a program associate specializing in counterterrorism at New America, a Washington-based think tank. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Much attention is being devoted to analyzing the significance of the death of Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the No. 2 leader for al Qaeda globally, in a reported U.S. drone strike last week. After all, he was the organization's second-ranking leader and headed the al Qaeda affiliate that has been consistently portrayed as the one that poses the greatest threat to the United States -- even more dangerous than ISIS, the breakaway al Qaeda affiliate and center of media focus, according to former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell. That view was shared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which tweeted: "We continue to assess that AQAP remains the al-Qa'ida affiliate most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the United States" as the President laid out his justification for strikes on ISIS. Al-Wuhayshi had the personal history to back up his claim as leader of the most threatening terrorist group. He was Osama bin Laden's personal secretary and body guard and was with the core al Qaeda leadership as it fled Afghanistan. He spent time in a Yemeni prison before escaping and becoming the leader of the newly formed AQAP. Yet as interesting as the man is the place where he was reportedly killed. The strike occurred in Al Mukalla, a Yemeni port in the province of Hadramaut and the fifth-largest city in Yemen. AQAP seized Al Mukalla in early April amid the chaos precipitated by Houthi rebel advances. AQAP's seizure of the city prompted extensive worry regarding the group's resurgence buoyed by the conflict. For example, The New York Times ran an article headlined "War in Yemen Is Allowing Qaeda Group to Expand," quoting Jamal Benomar, a U.N. diplomat who had been tasked with achieving political reconciliation in the country, as saying, "For the first time, al Qaeda is building a strategic alliance with the tribes," and, "It is a strengthened and dangerous al Qaeda. This is what worries everybody." While it is clear that AQAP has made great strides, there is another story in Al Mukalla -- a story of the constraints on jihadist power. Since AQAP seized the city, the United States conducted five drone strikes in the city's vicinity, according to data collected by New America. That constitutes nearly half of the strikes the United States has conducted in Yemen so far in 2015. Those five strikes have ripped holes in AQAP's leadership. Four AQAP leaders have been killed in Al Mukalla since the group seized the city. Al-Wuhayshi was reportedly killed in Al Mukalla on Friday. On April 22, a drone strike killed Muhannad Ghallab, a 35-year-old Egyptian who acted as an AQAP spokesman in the city. Also in April, Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi, the senior AQAP commander who appeared in a video claiming responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris by the Kouachi brothers, was killed by drone strike in Al Mukalla. And on April 13, a drone strike killed Ibrahim al Rubeish, a 35-year-old Saudi and former Guantanamo Bay prisoner, who served as a top spokesman and ideologue for the group. By taking Al Mukalla, AQAP gained much but also placed its leadership in a death trap. The deaths reveal the risks jihadist terrorist groups take by seizing territory. Even ISIS, the group that has made the most dramatic territorial gains when it conducted a blitzkrieg across northern Iraq, faced a similar challenge when its advances opened its forces up to the devastating effect of American air power. Of course, leadership deaths do not necessarily mean the end of an organization, and AQAP may still benefit overall from seizing the city. Though the subject of much debate, various studies have found leadership decapitation to have at most a limited effect on a terrorist group's fortunes. Other recent research suggests that decapitation can lead to more, and less selective, violence on the part of terrorist groups. Moreover, while air power is great at stopping advances, and also quite effective in killing selected leaders, it has a poor record in dislodging terrorist groups from territory they've seized. Despite these cautions, the recent wave of leadership deaths in Al Mukalla suggests there are real constraints on a group's ability to take advantage of instability and seize territory, even in a situation as chaotic as the war raging in Yemen.

            <corpo>(CNN)The United States announced the transfer of six detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Oman as part of an effort to eventually close the detention center in Cuba. All six detainees are Yemeni, and include alleged members of the al Qaeda terror group. With the latest transfer, 116 detainees remain at the facility as the clock ticks toward the end of President Barack Obama's term. Obama signed an executive order on his third day in office in January 2009 to begin the process of shutting down Guantanamo Bay. "The United States is grateful to the government of Oman for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility," the Defense Department said in a statement. Inmate's book exposes horrors of Gitmo The United States tries to find countries that will provide security against possible trouble from former prisoners and human rights assurances regarding the former inmates. Six federal departments and agencies that comprise the task force reviewing the Guantanamo camp unanimously approved the transfer, the statement said. Detainees from nations actively battling Islamist extremists -- such as Yemen -- are not released to their countries to ensure they don't join terror groups there. The detainees transferred to Oman on Friday are Idris Ahmad 'Abd Al Qadir Idris, Sharaf Ahmad Muhammad Mas'ud, Jalal Salam Awad Awad, Saa'd Nasser Moqbil Al Azani, Emad Abdallah Hassan, and Muhammad Ali Salem Al Zarnuki.

            <cabecalho>Egypt hopes Suez Canal expansion will see cash flood in - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Egypt's President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi hopes a facelift of the Suez Canal will breathe new life into Egypt's economy.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's arguably the most strategic waterway in the world. One that affects most lives on the planet. The Suez Canal may cut Africa off from Asia but it's a vital lifeline connecting the East and West. Now Egypt's President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi hopes its facelift will breathe new life into Egypt's economy. Everything about this project is ambitious. The funds needed for the new 70 kilometers of canal was raised within eight days. Only Egyptian citizens could invest in the project. The President gave responsibility of completing the task to Vice Admiral Mohab Mameesh of the Suez Canal Authority. After consulting experts he concluded it would take five years to complete -- but that wasn't good enough. "It would take five years, but we pushed and we made a pressure at the time and it will arrive in three years," Mameesh said. "But when [President el-Sisi] told me in one year, I said yes and changed all the plans." Since the project began 10 months ago, 41,000 people have been working around the clock. They'll move a total of half a trillion cubic meters of earth -- equivalent to moving 200 Great Pyramids. To help accomplish that task, Mameesh says he has employed 75% of the world's dredgers. The goal is to turn this one-way canal into a two-lane highway. Currently, ships have to wait to be part of three convoys with room for only eight megaships per day. Nearly 10% of all global maritime trade passes through the Suez Canal. That's 18,000 ships a year, a figure that Mameesh hopes the new canal will increase to 20,000. The navigation time will be reduced from 22 hours to 11 hours meaning the latest must-have electronics from Asia will arrive sooner.  Last year, the canal earned roughly $5.5 billion, which the government hopes to increase to $13.5 billion by 2023. It's an ambitious projection when global trade increases at roughly 5% annually. "The projected 13 billion are slated to come from passage fees and from the increase in number of ships but also efficiency and increase of maritime services presented to passing ships," says Mameesh. The new canal is envisioned to be the cornerstone of Egypt's next grand industrial project that'll be situated along its shores. The government hopes it'll create $100 billion in revenue and produce 1 million jobs. How this will be accomplished is not entirely known, as details are scarce. One potential roadblock to all of this is security. Militants aligned with ISIS wage a deadly insurgency next to the canal in Northern Sinai. Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting. About two years ago, militants fired a rocket propelled grenade at a passing boat in the canal, but no one was killed in the attack. Mameesh insists the boats are safe, with Egypt's military patrols helping to keep the roughly 100-mile (160 kilometer) canal secure. But the admiral's most pressing concern is making the August deadline and bringing the 150-year-old canal into the 21st century.  </corpo>

            <descricao>ISIS presents a very formidable enemy, one that the international community must fight together. </descricao>
            <corpo>Zainab Hawa Bangura is the United Nations special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict and serves as the United Nations' spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence. The views expressed are her own. (CNN)Nothing prepared me for what I saw and heard when I visited refugees from the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. As I traveled to Iraq and Syria, and to neighboring countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to meet with refugees and displaced women, I heard firsthand the horrifying stories of how they have been targeted in this conflict. I was told, for example, how mothers with babies were separated out by members of ISIL (also known as ISIS) because it is the younger women who they want to take. I heard how these younger women are examined to see if they are virgins, and how the younger and prettier they are, the more likely they are to get taken to ISIL's headquarters in Raqqa. And I heard how the rest are taken to open markets, where they will end up being auctioned after being examined like cattle. I was in the Middle East as the special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict, and while I had been monitoring the situation since the crisis began, this was the first time I was able to visit those who have been disproportionately affected by the conflict. The refugees and displaced women and girls I met told me how sexual violence is being committed strategically, in a systematic manner, and with a high degree of sophistication by most of the parties to the conflicts. Indeed, as I moved from country to country, I came to the terrible conclusion that this is in essence a war on women and girls, a group that finds itself under assault every day, and every step of the way, whether it be in areas of active conflict, those under control of armed actors, or at checkpoints and border crossings. But while it is true that most parties to the conflict are committing sexual violence, it is extremist groups like ISIL that have been particularly public and shameless in institutionalizing sexual violence and engaging in the brutalization of women and girls as a tactic of terror to advance their key strategic objectives. ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK For a start, it is clear that ISIL has been working to increase recruitment by promising male fighters access to women and girls. In addition, the group has been raising funds through the sale of women and girls in slave markets and through ransoms paid by relatives. And the group has also been using sexual violence to displace populations, while also using the threat of sexual violence to extract information for intelligence purposes. Women and girls I spoke with described being treated as property to be owned and traded, or else as vessels for producing children for fighters. In ISIL strongholds in Syria and Iraq, Raqqa and Mosul, women and girls are held in houses and buildings before they are inspected, selected and sold in "bazaars" where prices can be negotiated. Simply put, we have been witnessing the revival of the slave trade in the 21st century. What can and should we do? Such extreme violence requires political and security responses, but also legal and social response. For a start, all parties to the conflicts, both state and nonstate actors, have an obligation under international humanitarian law to prevent and punish such crimes. Second, U.N. agencies need greater support to be able to provide the necessary assistance and to be able to respond to the needs of the affected population, particularly women and girls who are suffering even in the places where they are seeking refuge. The reality is that the humanitarian appeals dealing with the provision of services to sexual violence survivors are underfunded, and neighboring countries are now also under tremendous pressure. Greater support is therefore needed not only for programs for refugees, but also to support host communities of neighboring countries that have absorbed an estimated 80% of the refugees. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS To address the transnational nature of ISIL, and the cross-border dimensions of the conflicts raging in the region, a concerted regional and international response is required, including improved information sharing across countries and a common counterterrorism response with women's protection and empowerment at its heart. Such a response should also look at the root causes of violent extremism, something that we cannot ignore any longer. Preventing abuses will require deeper engagement with communities, including with traditional and religious leaders who can help break the silence surrounding sexual violence and ensure that it is the perpetrators who are shamed and stigmatized, not the victims. In fact, if there was a glimmer of hope during my visit, it was the statement issued by the supreme spiritual leader of the Yazidi community, who said that women and girls released from ISIL captivity should be embraced and reintegrated by their families and communities. Countering ISIL's violent ideology will mean accepting these women and girls -- and any children they may have -- in a spirit of tolerance, dignity and respect. Ultimately, we cannot beat ISIL without understanding who they are, where they come from, and what their ideology is. The group presents a very formidable enemy, one that we must fight together.

            <corpo>Bradford, England (CNN)The husbands of British sisters who have gone missing with their children pleaded tearfully Tuesday for their families to come home amid fears they have headed to Syria, which is ravaged by terrorism and war. "You know, Mariya, I love you. I don't know what to say," said Akhtar Iqbal, the husband of Sugra Dawood, addressing his young daughter at a televised press conference in Britain. "I'm shaking and I miss you. It's been too many days. I don't where you are. Please come back home." Then he teared up as he addressed his whole family, "I miss you, I love you, all of you. I love you a lot. I can't live without you. Please, please call me. " Three sisters and their nine children from northern England disappeared while on a trip to the Middle East. The husbands of two of the sisters appealed for help in tracking the family down amid concerns the sisters could be trying to join a brother in Syria. "Please contact me," Mohammad Shoaib begged his wife, Khadija Dawood, at the press conference. "I am not angry. ... They are young kids, 7 and 5. And you know I love you so much." The husband of the third sister did not appear, as he is not in the UK. Balaal Khan, a lawyer acting for the Dawood family, said the three missing women and their children, ages 3 to 15, had traveled to Saudi Arabia on an Islamic pilgrimage on May 28. But instead of returning home to the city of Bradford, in northern England, as expected Thursday, they disappeared. They have not been in touch since June 9, and their cell phones have not been active, either. Nor have their social media profiles been updated in the past week, the statement said. The sisters have been named as Khadija Dawood, Sugra Dawood and Zohra Dawood, all in their 30s. Khadija Dawood's two children are Maryam Siddiqui, 7, and Muhammad Haseeb, 5; Sugra Dawood's five children are Junaid Ahmed Iqbal, Ibrahim Iqbal, Zaynab Iqbal, Mariya Iqbal and Ismaeel Iqbal, ages 15 to 3; and Zohra Dawood's two children are Haafiyah Binte Zubair, 8, and Nurah Binte Zubair, 5. Khan, the lawyer, said all 12 boarded a flight from Medina, Saudi Arabia, to Istanbul on June 9. Early reports that two of the children failed to board the plane were wrong, he said. The lawyer told journalists that there were no family problems and the husbands had no clue their wives were about to disappear. The families practice a moderate version of Islam, and there had been no indications of radicalization, he said. He said that a trip to Syria was only one possible theory for the family's disappearance. But he mentioned, as well, that there were concerns about how the women had been able to buy tickets from Saudi Arabia to Turkey.  The brother of the three missing women is already in Syria, Naz Shah, a member of Parliament from the Bradford area, told CNN. And that is why the family is so concerned about the whereabouts of the missing women and their children, she said. Shah added that she has "never heard of anything remotely like this in Bradford before." Turkey has become a popular transit route for people seeking to reach Syria, where ISIS and other opposition groups have been battling the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Another local Bradford member of Parliament, Imran Hussain, has asked Britain's Foreign Office to help find the family. The Foreign Office said: "We are in contact with West Yorkshire police and Turkish authorities and are ready to provide consular assistance."  The Dawood family reported the women and children's disappearance to police after they failed to return as expected. Officers are investigating their whereabouts and are "working extensively with authorities overseas to try and locate them," a statement from West Yorkshire police said. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster said: "We are extremely concerned for the safety of the family and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. "Our priority is for their safe return; their families are gravely worried about them and want them home. One of our primary concerns is the safety and welfare of the young children." News of the Dawoods' disappearance came shortly after family members of a teenage boy from West Yorkshire said they were "devastated and heartbroken" after ISIS released a photo showing the 17-year-old in front of an ISIS black flag. There are fears the boy, Talha Asmal from Dewsbury, may have been involved in ISIS suicide attacks near the Iraqi city of Baiji. Other teens have also been swept up in the allure of ISIS. Earlier this year, three teenage British girls were seen on airport surveillance footage heading to Syria. A Scottish teenager wrote extensively on her Tumblr account about her love of ISIS. She stunned her family, left the country and became an ISIS bride and recruiter. An American teenager from suburban Chicago, Mohammed Hamzah Khan, allegedly was on his way to join ISIS in October when he was stopped at an airport. CNN's Nic Robertson and Bharati Naik reported from Bradford, while Laura Smith-Spark and CNN's Don Melvin wrote from London. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>Just picking off the leaders of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda isn't an effective strategy </descricao>
            <corpo>Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." (CNN)American counterterrorism officials have had much to celebrate in recent days: the killing of ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in Syria and the trove of "intel" that was taken from his residence by U.S. special forces; the death of the leader of al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, in a drone strike; and the possible death in Libya of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of a virulent North African jihadist group. But the leadership of these groups is generally replaceable. Consider the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS, until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006. Since then, a number of other leaders from al-Zarqawi's group have been killed, but that did not prevent from ISIS becoming ISIS -- a group that today lords over millions of people and occupies territory in Syria and Iraq that is around the size of the United Kingdom. To be sure, any counterterrorism campaign that eliminates many leaders of a group can have a real impact -- al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan is a shadow of what it once was, in part, because of a deadly campaign of CIA drone strikes that eliminated many of its leaders and middle managers. Yet, if we zoom out to the bigger picture, from Libya on the northern coast of Africa to Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the spaces in which jihadist militant groups can operate have greatly opened up as a result of the early promise of the Arab Spring turning into the grim reality of the Arab winter. The resulting chaotic conditions and weakened states have proven a boon to ISIS and to al Qaeda and its affiliates: -- In Yemen, al Qaeda has taken advantage of the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Hadi government to seize control of large swaths of southern Yemen, including the country's fifth largest city, Mukalla. -- In Libya, jihadist groups including ISIS control about a tenth of the country, according to a senior U.S. government official. -- In Syria, al-Qaeda's local affiliate, the Nusra Front, together with ISIS are now the most powerful groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and each control large sections of the country. -- In Iraq, ISIS controls the second largest city, Mosul, and much of Anbar province, which is about a third of the landmass of the country. What to do about all this is a puzzle because much of Middle East is in the grip of a regional, sectarian civil war fomented by Iran and the Gulf States and is evolving into a Rubik's Cube-like problem that has no good solution, because when you move one piece of the cube it can create both solutions and a new set of problems simultaneously. To get a sense of how complex this Rubik's Cube is: Consider that the United States is training Syrian opposition forces to fight the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad, while it is also training Iraqi forces of the Iran-backed Iraqi government to fight ISIS. The U.S. therefore is effectively supporting both sides of the wars in Syria and Iraq. Describing problems is always, of course, much easier than solving them, but here are some ideas that can help the U.S. achieve its strategic goals in the Middle East -- dismantling ISIS and al Qaeda and avoiding a long-running sectarian regional civil war: Curtail the foreign fighter flow ISIS is taking around 1,000 casualties a month in U.S.-led airstrikes, yet it's also recruiting around 1,000 "foreign fighters" from around the Muslim world every month, so the military campaign against ISIS is something of a draw. The U.S. should put pressure on Middle Eastern countries, which supply the bulk of the foreign fighters to the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts, to curtail the flow of their nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has already made some strides in that direction, but this should also be a priority for other Arab governments. Let American soldiers go forward The exact number of U.S. troops in Iraq is not the germane issue right now. It's the constrictive rules of engagement that have been imposed upon them that prevent them from getting "outside the wire" of the bases that they are assigned to. What is needed are rules of engagement that allow U.S. forward air controllers calling in precise airstrikes as well as U.S. advisers embedded with Iraqi troops on the frontlines. Not only will this help to place more accurate air strikes on ISIS positions, but also Iraqi troops with embedded Americans will have better military advice and the comfort of knowing that they will get close American air support if ISIS threatens them. Right now that isn't the case. Step up the air campaign in Syria and Iraq One of the world's experts on counterinsurgency, New America fellow David Kilcullen suggests increasing the tempo of of the air campaign. Kilcullen points out that the average rate of coalition air strikes since last August into Syria and Iraq is about 10 per day, while in the successful air campaign against the Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, it was around 250 per day, suggesting that the U.S.-led coalition can still ratchet up the pressure on ISIS significantly. Resist calls to split Iraq up into Sunnistan, Shiastan and Kurdistan Iraq is a country where many of its citizens are products of Shia-Sunni marriages and cities like Mosul and Baghdad remain mixtures of many ethnic and religious groups. Trying to separate out Iraq into sectarian and ethnic cantons will only fuel the sectarian passions in Iraq and in the region. The model to avoid, albeit on a larger scale, was the disastrous 1947 partition of India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states in which 1 million people died. If the Iran nuclear deal gets done, use it as leverage to show al-Assad the door Use the goodwill tendered by a deal with Iran to have the Iranians pressure their close ally, al-Assad, to step down, while maintaining much of his regime in place. That way the coalition of Alawites, Christians and other regime supporters will be assured that if al-Assad goes, they won't have to go down with him and will have a stake in some kind of peace deal, rather than fighting to the death. Keep pressure on the Saudis not to resume their counterproductive air campaign in Yemen That campaign had the effect of further fracturing the already-fracturing country, which has benefited al Qaeda.

            <corpo>Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's administration is planning to train Sunni tribes' fighters as part of its move to send up to 450 additional U.S. forces to Iraq, the White House said Wednesday. The United States is also sending weapons to Sunni tribes, as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are operating under Iraqi command, in order to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The hope, an Obama administration official said, is that a new "Sunni uprising" similar to one that took place in 2013 will occur - but this time, aimed at Islamic State fighters. "This is designed to focus on training the Sunnis," the official said. The additional U.S. military personnel will train and advise Iraqi and tribal troops at the Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar province. Sunni fighters will continue with the standard practice of undergoing a security review by the Iraq's before they are permitted to join, to ensure they do not have loyalties to ISIS, the official said. RELATED: Obama says 'no complete strategy' in training Iraqi troops The Associated Press was the first to report earlier Tuesday that the administration was considering sending up to 1,000 U.S. forces to the country. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told reporters traveling with him in Jerusalem on Tuesday that Obama has asked military brass to "take a look at what we've learned over the last eight months in the train-and-equip program and make recommendations to him on whether there are capabilities that we may want to provide to the Iraqis to actually make them more capable." RELATED: Rumsfeld defends remarks about democracy in Iraq "He's asked us to look at whether there are other locations where we might establish training sites," Dempsey said. "He's asked us to take a look at how we might develop Iraq's leaders." There are currently about 3,050 U.S. forces in Iraq. Roughly 2,250 of them are devoted to supporting Iraqi security forces, approximately 450 are training Iraqi troops and about 200 more are acting in advising and assisting roles.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>Al-Mazraa, Iraq (CNN)Al-Mazraa is a dusty village just south of Baiji, where a battle is raging between ISIS fighters and pro-government Iraqi forces trying to push them out. Under normal circumstances it's a sleepy farming town just off the Saddam Hussein-era highway linking Baghdad and Mosul. Today it's a staging point for pro-government forces heading into nearby Baiji. Battered, bullet-pocked Humvees and armored pick-up trucks rumble through the trash-strewn main street, while young soldiers and militiamen mill around in the shade seeking relief from the brutal mid-day heat. A few residents mix with the fighters, including little boys curious about all the newcomers. A month ago Al-Mazraa, a village of Sunni Arabs, was in the hands of ISIS, but according to resident Ammer Hashd Jraish, their hands were light. "They would drive through here, but never stopped here," he says. Today Jraish, a man in his late forties with the ubiquitous dark moustache and sporting combat fatigues, is a member of the town council. He's a member of the Hashd Al-Shaabi, the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), a Shia-led paramilitary force partially armed, trained and advised by Iran. Although a Sunni, he -- like many others in Al-Mazraa -- has taken up arms with the Shia-led PMU. Jraish insists he had nothing to do with ISIS during the year they controlled the area. I met him in the PMU's command center in Al-Mazraa, a sitting room in a villa full of chairs with maps on the walls and a big computer screen featuring another map of Baiji and the adjacent refinery. Sitting next to the screen is a man perhaps in his sixties with a trim white beard and white hair. It's Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, PMU's commander and arguably the most powerful military leader in Iraq. In this war where ironies abound, Al-Muhandis is on the U.S. government's list of designated terrorists for his involvement in the Iraqi insurgency, and for involvement in terrorist acts in Kuwait in the 1980s. But today he, like the United States, is fighting ISIS. CNN producer Hamdi Alkhshali and I introduce ourselves to Al-Muhandis, who initially declines our request for a quick on-camera interview. After a little coaxing, however, he begins to explain the situation in Baiji on one of the maps on the wall, quickly conceding that despite what we were told by Iraqi officials in Baghdad, pro-government forces only control about 50% of the town and still have a way to go before retaking the refinery, Iraq's largest. He is hesitant to be drawn on the United States and its role in the war on ISIS, brushing off questions with "it does not concern me" or "these are agreements between the Iraqi government and the United States." After much pressing, he expresses scorn. "It's clear," he says: "The international coalition isn't serious in its operations. That's why Ramadi fell." Others in the room, including the commander of Iraqi Army operations in Baiji, Major General Jumaa Anad, nod in agreement. Al-Muhandis points to the map, to a bridge over the Tigris River north of Baiji. "This bridge is on the main ISIS supply line between Baiji and Mosul. Every day for months now, fighters, equipment and ammunition move over this bridge. But until now the international coalition hasn't hit it." Major General Anad, a 37-year veteran of the Iraqi Army, expresses the consternation one hears from many in Iraq these days, noting that it took the U.S. and its allies only 22 days to utterly defeat Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. "When the United States wants to do something, it does it," he tells me. "We fought them twice, in 1991 and 2003. They have incredible capabilities. If they were serious, they could crush ISIS." When I ask him his reaction to the news that the Obama administration will send more than 400 additional troops to train the Iraqi Army, supplementing the around 3,100 already here, he scoffs. "We don't need training, we need weapons. To detect land mines we are using sticks, just like in World War One. The Americans have the latest technology for land mines. That's the kind of help we need." We didn't get a very close look at the fighting in Baiji. Mid-afternoon we ended up on the rooftop of a house commandeered by Sunni PMU fighters about 2.5 kilometers east of the town center. The house was littered with half-eaten meals of rice and meat, hundreds of empty water bottles, clothing strewn all over the place. In one of the rooms a young man applies a bandage to his leg. Explaining the lay of the land before us, local Sunni commander Khalil Awa says, "until now there are skirmishes with the remnants of ISIS, while others are fleeing toward Mosul." Others on the rooftop tell us the ISIS fighters, whom they listen in to on their walkie-talkies, are a mixture of Chechnyans, Central Asians and Iraqis from Mosul. From the rooftop we could hear small arms fire coming from Baiji, and an occasional thud, but could make out little else, everything is second-hand. The haze is too thick.  </corpo>

            <descricao>South Korean officials announced one more death in the country's MERS outbreak Wednesday, raising the total death toll to 20.</descricao>
            <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)South Korean officials announced one more death in the country's MERS outbreak Wednesday, raising the total death toll to 20. Eight new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) were also announced, bringing the total number to 162 -- 18 of whom are in an "unstable" condition, according to South Korea's Ministry of Health. The number of people under quarantine in South Korea, both in their own homes or in quarantine facilities, rose by 922 from Tuesday to 6,508. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the number of new cases "appears to be declining" -- indicating that the outbreak could be slowing down. But it also warned that "all outbreaks are unpredictable." "This is especially true for a comparatively new disease like MERS" where many facets of the virus are not well understood, the WHO said. Earlier this week, there had been a sign of a possible return to normalcy, as thousands of schools across South Korea re-opened after closures due to the deadly outbreak. But it came with heightened awareness; children's temperatures were monitored in classrooms and teachers warned students to practice personal hygiene and frequently wash their hands. Not all schools have reopened; 440 remain shut as officials seek to stop the spread of MERS. The WHO had recommended re-opening institutions last week because transmission of the virus had not been linked to schools. The MERS outbreak remains largely confined to health care settings. Should you be worried about MERS?  The outbreak has sparked international concern, stalled the nation's economy and resulted in over 100,000 canceled tourist visits to the country. Korea's department store sales tumbled 16.5% compared with the same period last year and retail shops also decreased 3.4%, according to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The ongoing situation has put Korean authorities under scrutiny for their inability to contain MERS cases and President Park Geun-hye has seen her approval ratings plummet. In a news conference Monday, the Ministry of Health announced that a special task force had been sent to South Korea's second largest city, Busan, after learning that one of the most recently diagnosed MERS patient had visited several hospitals and clinics in the area. "We are doing our best to stop the spread of MERS," said the Korean minister of health. "We are analyzing the CCTV with the help of Busan police," referring to tracking down who had been at the hospitals.  Researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and China's Fudan University have been working on an antibody treatment that could fight MERS. An antibody is a protein that combats pathogens like viruses and bacteria. The antibody treatment has only been through lab and animal tests so far and requires trials on humans before it could be available to MERS patients. While the antibody, named m336, has been effective in animals, it has yet to be tested on MERS patients, said Professor Jiang Shibo from Fudan University. All U.S. drugs are required to have human trials, as there are treatments that work in animals but turn out to be ineffective in people. The human trial process could take three to four years, but experimental treatments can be used if patients and the local government consent. So far, m336 has been considered the most potent of several antibodies that could be used to fight MERS, according to a scientific summary published in the Journals Center for Cancer Research.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has recorded five cases of MERS in the past week, the official state-run Saudi press agency said Sunday, citing a weekly Ministry of Health statement. It included one death of a 73-year-old man who died in the city of Turaba and had a pre-existing condition. The strain of coronavirus that causes MERS was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. The man believed to be "patient zero" in the current outbreak in South Korea visited Saudi Arabia in May, along with three other Middle Eastern countries. That 68-year-old patient went from facility-to-facility near or around Seoul before getting properly diagnosed. It triggered the hospital-based transmission of MERS in South Korea. The South Korean outbreak is the largest outside of Saudi Arabia -- over 5,000 people remain in quarantine.  In Seoul, Samsung Medical Center -- one of the city's hospitals that has counted many of the nation's MERS cases among its patients and visitors -- announced Sunday that it will suspend all surgical procedures except for emergency surgery "to fully focus on responding to MERS." More than 50 confirmed MERS cases have been traced back to the medical center, according to the center's website. The medical center, located in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district and considered one of the most prominent hospitals in the capital, issued an apology for its handling of MERS. "We sincerely apologize with our heads bent to the people for causing great concern as Samsung Medical Center became the center (of) the spread of MERS," hospital President Song Jae-hoon said. 5 things to know about MERS CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul. Journalists Evonne Liu and Han Sol, and CNN's Kay Guerrero, Kathy Novak and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Almost four times as many children have died in the past 10 weeks as a result of the conflict in Yemen as were killed in the whole of 2014, according to UNICEF. At least 279 children have died since the latest violence escalated in March, compared to a total of 74 last year, the United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement. Over the same 10 weeks, 402 were injured -- with 244 injured last year, the statement said. Some children have been drawn directly into the fighting between armed groups in Yemen. UNICEF said 318 children have been recruited and used to man checkpoints or carry arms this year -- double last year's number. "Children continue to be killed, maimed or recruited to fight," said Julien Harneis, UNICEF's representative in Yemen. "They should be safely learning in school, not trying to escape bullets on the front lines."  UNICEF is backing a call by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for a pause in the fighting during the holy month of Ramadan, which begins Thursday. Yemen has been torn by fighting between the Houthi Shiite militiamen and government forces loyal to President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi fled the capital, Sanaa, in March. Iran has been accused of backing the Houthi rebels -- something it denies. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in a bid to counteract what it sees as Iranian influence in the region.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Kurdish fighters claimed Tuesday to have taken the strategic Syrian town of Tal Abyad from ISIS. The town is close to the border with Turkey, about 310 miles (500 kilometers) northeast of Damascus, and lies on a main road to Raqqa, the city ISIS considers to be its capital. Fighting between the Kurdish forces and ISIS went on until dawn Tuesday, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the Kurds had taken "full control" of the town. The Observatory said at least 40 members of the terrorist group were killed as they tried to run into another town in the area. The town's loss will probably cut off an important ISIS supply route. The strategic advance comes a day after the Kurdish YPG, or People's Protection Units, captured the Syrian side of a Turkish border crossing at Akcakale. ISIS -- or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a terrorist group whose members are predominately Sunni -- is trying to establish a caliphate in the Middle East. It has become known for beheading captives and posting videos of the killings online. Kurdish fighters have already taken about 50 towns and villages from ISIS, Miami Herald columnist Frida Ghitis, quoting the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, wrote Monday in an opinion piece for CNN. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali in Baghdad contributed to this report. CNN's Larry Register and Khushbu Shah also contributed. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A Moroccan magazine has withdrawn its latest edition from the shelves after controversy over a front cover that showed two men at a swimming pool gazing into each other's eyes with the headline, "Should homosexuals be burned?" A statement released by the magazine, Maroc Hebdo (Morocco Weekly), on Friday said its decision to pull the edition -- in paper form and online -- followed "strong reactions" to it, particularly on social media. The statement, issued in the name of editor Mohamed Selhami, also apologized to anyone shocked by the subject matter. "Our publication is not a political editorial that pushes a certain sensationalism or provocative topics that can offend the public," it said. "In this instance, it wanted to show the different sides of a social fact; homosexuality and by extension its status in our society. A debate on today's agenda. Maroc Hebdo wanted in this respect to give an account of this debate." At the same time it announced the edition's withdrawal, the magazine offered "an apology to all readers who could be shocked by this topic and reminds them that it will continue working on opening up a national debate on democracy in our society and the values on which it was founded." Homosexuality is illegal the majority Muslim, North African nation. According to rights group Human Rights Watch, those convicted of homosexual acts under Moroccan law can be sentenced to up to three years in prison and a fine.

            <cabecalho>Who is the 2,000-year-old 'sleeping beauty'? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Anthropologists have uncovered the grave of a 2,000 year old skeleton curled up on her side. Who was this' well-loved' lady?</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It was the Queen of Sheba that first drew Louise Schofield -- an archaeologist and former curator at the British Museum -- to the Gheralta plateau in northern Ethiopia. She'd heard tell of a 20-foot stone stele carved with an inscription and a symbol often linked to the biblical queen: a sun and crescent moon. "The story of the Queen of Sheba has a central place in the heart of all Ethiopians, so I became interested in the story myself," she recalls (Sheba is thought to be located in parts of Ethiopia). It was this initial visit that ultimately led her to discover the 2,000-year-old remains of a character she fondly refers to as "sleeping beauty." The grave was discovered at the stone stele, in an area that was once part of the ancient kingdom of Aksum, which today encompasses Ethiopia and Eritrea. Inside, Schofield's team found the skeleton of a woman posed in a resting position, with her chin laid gently on one hand. A Roman-era bronze mirror was placed before her face. The corpse was surrounded with glass vessels (to catch the tears of the dead), as well as a bronze cosmetics spoon and a lump of kohl eyeliner. "She must have been very wealthy, and probably well-loved to be placed in this position, and judging by all the items of finery around her," surmised Schofield. The dig also uncovered several other graves, all of which had several bodies buried beneath. In some, she found the remains of large warriors clad who each wore an iron bangle. "We think they were warriors from a battle," she says. The unusual find suggests trade between Rome and Aksum started at least 200 years earlier than previously believed. As the dig is less than a month old, there's still a lot of information yet to come in about this restful lady. A bone expert wasn't able to ascertain her age at the time of death because the pelvis -- which usually provides a close approximation -- had been consumed by termites. Schofield hopes that analysis of the teeth will provide some answers. "There was something very personal about the way she was lying," Schofield says. The remains were also found surrounded by clay containers that likely contained food or drink (these have also been sent off for analysis). "The food, drink and cosmetics were all presumably left for her to use in the afterlife. She was pre-Christian and that's how people buried their dead then," says Schofield. Shofield has a bit of the Midas touch when it comes to extraordinary finds. She also recently uncovered a Roman-era perfume flask in the same cemetery, although by chance. The archaeologist is also the director of London-based NGO The Tigray Trust, and the item was first brought to her attention by a local farmer she knew through the organization. "I had been showing around a member of the Peace Corps who had been working in a nearby town (around the site), and we'd been out in the blazing sun for 8 hours, when a farmer I knew said his friend found something old, and he'd been keeping it for me," she recalls. "I was apologizing to the Peace Corps guy. I told him, 'it could be an old coffee pot, but you never know, it could be the Queen of Sheba's perfume flask.'"

            <descricao>On the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. Shereen El Feki says that needs to change.</descricao>
            <corpo>Shereen El Feki is the author of "Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World," a study of changing sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET. Cairo, Egypt (CNN)In a packed Cairo theater a couple of months ago, Ali Qandil brought down the house. "Why do Egyptian fathers cry at their daughters' weddings?" the comedian asked the crowd. "Because they know their little girls will be having sex for the first time." In Egypt's current conservative climate, Qadil's well-aimed thrust at sexual taboos was enough to send the audience into stitches, even as the theater management reached for its smelling salts. The show was courtesy of Al-Hubb Thaqafa ("Love is Culture"), a groundbreaking social media platform offering straight talk on love, sex and relationships in Arabic. Launched just over a year ago, its website, YouTube channel and social feeds have attracted more than nine million visitors, mainly from Egypt and Morocco. Al-Hubb Thaqafa's no-nonsense approach to sex, offering accurate information on everything from the basic facts of life to the finer points of fellatio, is a welcome development in a region where teachers are often too embarrassed to communicate even the barebones sexual and reproductive curriculum on offer, and parents generally draw a veil of silence over such topics with their kids. For Ali Qandil, sex is an endless source of humor -- just as it is anywhere else in the world. But on the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. In recent weeks, accounts of the arrest and abuse of dozens of gay men and transsexual women in Egypt, or mass sexual exploitation under ISIS' reign of terror, or Morocco's recent ban on a new film which lays bare the country's thriving sex trade, do little to dispel the image of societies mired in sexual repression. But by emphasizing sex as a pleasure to be enjoyed, rather than a problem to be solved, Al-Hubb Thaqafa hearkens to a long tradition of free and frank exchange on sexual matters in Arabic. Short of cybersex and internet porn, there isn't much its platforms tackle that our forefathers from weren't writing about more than a millennium ago. READ MORE: 13 signs you're probably in Cairo There is nothing un-Islamic about talking about sex; indeed, many of the great works of Arabic erotica were written by religious scholars. But over the centuries, and in particular in recent decades with rise of Islamic fundamentalism, societies across the Arab region have become far less comfortable in their sexual skin. Al-Hubb Thaqafa offers a chance (in part by reclaiming Arabic as a language of sexuality and offering a "respectable" alternative to street slang) for men and women to talk each other about sex -- asking questions, sharing personal experiences and contesting each other's opinions without the usual embarrassment or censure. Such opportunities are all too rare offline. It's been two years since I published "Sex and the Citadel" -- a five-year investigation into sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region, and their intersection with politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations. Since then, the grand political aspirations which fed the Arab Spring have either frosted over, as in Egypt, or burnt up in the conflagration now consuming Libya, Yemen and Syria. Sex might seem an odd focus these days, given all the other pressing issues in the region. But it is never far from politics, as authoritarian powers -- be they military-backed presidents or religious extremists -- know only too well, using matters of flesh, wrapped in selective interpretations of Islam, to clamp down on their communities. This is sadly true beyond the borders of the Middle East as well. But the converse also holds. Realizing the rallying cries of the recent uprisings -- "freedom", "justice" and "dignity" -- in private life will, in the long run, have profound implications for public life as well. When it comes to sex, it is never black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In this, as with so many other aspects of life, there are at least 50 shades of gray. On my travels, I've met men and women across the Arab region who are exploring that spectrum. Doctors like Chafik Chraibi, a Moroccan obstetrician whose efforts to open up his country's restrictive abortion laws have helped to catalyze a recent small step in legal reform. Educators like Safa Tamish, a Palestinian living in Israel, who is working to get sex education into schools and families across the West Bank. Or activists like the founders of Chouf and Damj, two new Tunisian NGOS, which are among the dozens of groups across the region trying to find a place for men and women whose sexualities or gender identities break the mold. There are many, many more such initiatives -- combating sexual violence, or securing the rights of unwed mothers or providing sexual health services to unmarried youth, for example -- springing up across the Middle East, often on very rocky ground. The most successful work slowly, along the grain of religion and culture. Confrontation -- be it political protests in Tahrir Square or Femen-style baring of breasts -- is not the way to achieve tangible, durable change in the Arab region, as recent events have clearly demonstrated. For too many -- particularly women -- sex is still bound up in shame, which makes it a powerful tool of political and social control. Sexual freedoms are hard to exercise when family interests trump individual choice, or when appearance counts for more than reality -- when virginity is defined by a piece of anatomy -- an intact hymen -- rather than a state of chastity, or when prostitution masquerades as marriage between wealthy visitors and desperate refugees. Shifting the political, economic and social conditions which underpin these realities is the work of a generation at least. But at least in a few places, positive change is slowly taking root. As my Egyptian grandmother used to say, "If there were seeds for patience, I would have planted fields." In other words, what we need is a sexual evolution, not revolution.

            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)A court in Egypt upheld a death sentence Tuesday against former President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, 63, was sentenced to death last month for his role in a 2011 prison break. Morsy, along with 16 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders, was also given a life sentence for espionage. Life in Egypt means 25 years. Three more senior members of the organization -- Khairat Al Shater, Mohamed Beltagy and Ahmed Abdel Alaty -- were sentenced to death by hanging. The political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the decision "politicized" and the charges "fabricated." "President Morsy's trial has fallen far below the most basic international legal standards," a statement from the Muslim Brotherhood said. "Today's announcement is another nail in the coffin for democracy in Egypt." It called on the international community to stop what it called the "cruel dictatorship" of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The military ousted Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, in 2013.

            <cabecalho>Sudan's Omar al-Bashir leaves South Africa - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir left South Africa, government confirms, as court considered whether to arrest him on war crimes charges. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, a man accused of war crimes and genocide, has left South Africa one step ahead of the law. Al-Bashir left the country Monday just as a South African High Court decided to order his arrest. The human rights group that had petitioned the court to order al-Bashir's arrest, the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, said in a statement it was disappointed that the government allowed the Sudanese President to leave before the ruling. Judge Hans Fabricius had ruled Sunday that al-Bashir had to stay in South Africa while a court considered whether he should be arrested. The judge also ordered all ports in the country to prevent the Sudanese leader from leaving. But lawyers arguing in court for al-Bashir's arrest warned, in advance, that the ports of entry and exit were not obeying the judge's order. "Being an organisation committed to the rule of law, SALC is encouraged by the Court's order and the independence of the judicial process," said Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, the group's director. "The rule of law, however, is only as strong as the government which enforces it. Home Affairs have allowed a fugitive from justice to slip through its fingers, compounding the suffering of the victims of these grave crimes." Al-Bashir's departure was confirmed by the South African and Sudanese governments. Sudan's state news agency, SUNA, reported that Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour would hold a news conference at the airport Monday evening "following return of the President of the Republic." It is unclear in light of the judge's order what help al-Bashir might have received, and from whom. His plane had been relocated earlier from Tambo International Airport, near Johannesburg, to Waterkloof military base, south of Pretoria. And sometime after that, the alleged war criminal went to the military base and slipped through the net.  His departure came as the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria was considering a request by the International Criminal Court to arrest him on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The ICC charges against al-Bashir stem from the conflict in the Darfur region in western Sudan, which began in 2003. The government of Sudan has been accused of repression and ethnic cleansing of Darfur's non-Arab population. Al-Bashir had been in South Africa attending a two-day summit of African Union leaders. Fabricius, the judge, said Sunday that he wanted to determine whether it was legally acceptable for Pretoria to allow al-Bashir to visit South Africa without arresting him -- and key in that decision would be determining if the South African Cabinet's decision not to comply with the ICC demand could trump an international treaty, South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper reported.  Earlier Monday, when al-Bashir's whereabouts were still unclear, the chairman of South Africa's Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation, Siphosezwe Masango, said he was concerned about the Sudanese President's possible arrest. "This is an opportunistic act only meant to pit African leaders against each other in the name of international law," Masango said in a statement. He urged the leaders gathered for the summit to concentrate instead on regional trade, xenophobia and the development of Africa's infrastructure. He said the ICC appeared to target African leaders and, if the trend continued, his committee might have to recommend that the government re-examine South Africa's membership in the international court. But the U.N.'s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, warned that member states had to follow ICC rules. "It is of deep concern to me and my office when court orders are issued by the ICC in respect of the serving head of state of Sudan, and state parties to the Rome Statute openly flout them," he said Monday at a meeting of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The Rome Statute was a treaty that established the International Criminal Court. "In this regard, we await the ruling of the Pretoria High Court this morning, as it assesses the request submitted by the ICC," he said. Sidiki Kaba, the Senegalese justice minister who serves as president of the assembly of states parties to the Rome Statute, expressed his "deep concern about the negative consequences for the court in case of nonexecution of the warrants by States Parties and, in this regard, urges them to respect their obligations to cooperate with the Court." South Africa, Kaba said in a statement, should "spare no effort" to arrest al-Bashir. South Africa had twice before threatened to arrest al-Bashir -- in 2009 before President Jacob Zuma's inauguration and in 2010 before the World Cup, according to the Southern Africa Litigation Centre. He attended neither event, according to news reports.  Arrest warrants from 2009 and 2010 outline the case against al-Bashir and allege that during the Darfur conflict he ordered the military, police and Janjaweed militia to attack three ethnic groups deemed sympathetic to rebel outfits with "the specific intent to destroy in part" those groups. As part of that campaign, the warrants say, the Sudanese President ordered the rape, murder and torture of civilians and the razing of villages. The United Nations has estimated that as many as 300,000 people have been killed in the Darfur conflict since 2003, a tally the Sudanese government says is inflated. Another 7 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates. Putting a face on refugee crisis Last week, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations told the Security Council that the ongoing violence in Darfur was having a "devastating" impact on civilians. More than 78,000 civilians have been displaced this year, the U.N. reports. CNN's Brent Swails and Tony Wende contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>A parole board will recommend that Oscar Pistorius, convicted in the killing of his girlfriend, be released from prison in August.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A parole board is set to recommend that the disgraced athlete Oscar Pistorius, convicted in the killing of his girlfriend, be released from prison in August, South Africa's Department of Correctional Services told CNN on Monday. Pistorius, 28, was sentenced in October to five years in prison for culpable homicide in the killing of Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013. In South Africa, culpable homicide means a person was killed unintentionally but unlawfully. Pistorius acknowledged firing shots through the bathroom door in his home, but said he thought there was an intruder in the bathroom rather than his girlfriend. Pistorius' fall from grace was one of the most dramatic since that of O.J. Simpson, the American football player turned sports announcer and movie star, who was charged with murder in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson was acquitted in a criminal trial but found responsible for the deaths in a subsequent civil suit. Like Simpson, Pistorius was handsome, popular and wealthy from commercial endorsements when the charges were filed. In his 2014 trial, a judge found Pistorius to be not guilty of murder. Prosecutors are appealing that verdict. Both of Pistorius' legs were amputated before his first birthday. In the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Pistorius became the first athlete with both legs amputated to participate in the Olympic Games, running in the 400-meter race and the 4x400 meter relay. Under South African law, Pistorius must serve at least one-sixth of his sentence -- 10 months -- before being released. The parole board is prepared to recommend that he be released on August 21, 10 months to the day since his sentencing. Steenkamp's parents reportedly wrote a letter to the parole board in protest, calling for accountability. South African broadcaster eNCA published the letter, which read, in part: "As her family, we do not seek to avenge her death and we do not want Mr. Pistorius to suffer; that will not bring her back to us. However a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions. "Statistics show that our society is under continuous attack from criminals and murderers. Incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough. We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)It seemed like the number of people contracting Ebola in West Africa was on the decline. But now, officials say that trend has stalled, with dozens of new cases of the deadly virus reported so far this month. Last week, there were 31 new cases of Ebola reported in a growing geographic area in Guinea and Sierra Leone, the World Health Organization said. At the beginning of this week, 14 additional cases were reported. The latest figures mark the second straight week that the number of Ebola cases in West Africa has increased, officials said. Investigators are working to trace how the latest cases of the disease were contracted, the WHO said. "The outbreak is not over and the response efforts must be sustained until we get to zero cases throughout the region and are able to stay at zero for several months," the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response said Thursday. Last month, officials from the WHO declared Liberia free of the disease. But even as they trumpeted the news, officials warned that outbreaks in Guinea and Sierra Leone ran the risk of bringing the virus back to Liberia, where more than 4,000 people died after contracting Ebola. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Five things Buhari must tackle now that he's president - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>As Nigeria's new president takes over, one of those who worked to get him elected explains what he needs to do to restore the country's prospects.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Chude Jideonwo is managing partner of Red Media Africa, which runs Africa's largest portfolio of youth media brands. One of the brands, StateCraft Inc was official communication agency to the Buhari Presidential Campaign and spent the past six months working to get him elected. Below he details the five things that the president must do now that he's in power. The opinions expressed are solely those of Chude Jideonwo's. (CNN)Disclosure is important: I have been part of a team that worked for the new Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari -- from building the cache of photos that defined his image to getting fliers across the country in all of our languages. I have gone from grudgingly voting for him in 2011 (I made up my mind an hour before voting) to enthusiastically putting relationships and business on the line for what seemed like a quixotic quest. But long after Muhammadu Buhari is President of Nigeria's Federal Republic, I will still be a citizen. And as a citizen, I know, that by this evening, the honeymoon will be over. He knows this more than anyone else, and he certainly doesn't need advice to do what he does best -- work hard, and fast. Still, these would be my suggestions for his top five priorities. Set an example: The cult of personality that led President Buhari to victory was built on a simple premise -- Nigeria, for once, needs a man shorn of greed; who owns less in terms of material, and covets even less. There are those who insist that the fate of a nation cannot lie solely on Buhari's personality, and perhaps they are right. But the 'lau lau' (Nigerian slang for wasteful) lifestyle of the president who is leaving office led to unprecedented waste, and turned corruption into art. Now, because of Buhari's reputation, governments and corporate Nigeria have begun to tighten their belts. Oil marketers are suspended in terror; people even expect the cost of land in Nigeria to drop. If he steps into power, and changes; then nothing he says and nothing he does will matter. It will ruin everything. And what a darn shame that will be. Subsidy has to go There has long been a media and elite consensus that Nigeria's labyrinth of petro-politics -- which swallows at least $4.2 billion yearly in the name of subsidy -- is a scam. Unfortunately, because he lacked both the credibility and the vision to overhaul that system, Nigerians rightly railed against President Goodluck Jonathan when he tried to remove the subsidy in 2012. The argument was simple -- why force us to tighten our belts when you continue to buy new presidential jets? Thankfully, President Buhari has the competence (as former oil minister) and the personal credibility to make that decision now. It will be a bloody billion-dollar fight. But he, frankly, has no choice. #BringBackOurGirls The President-Elect has said he cannot know if the 219 Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko Haram last year will be found, and he is right. Still, Boko Haram has ravaged this country in many ways, but above all it has stolen our faith in government. The girls stand as a symbol of our hopelessness -- that despite a world unified in horror and haste, our government has yet failed. To re-inspire a nation to reconnect with its strength and its will, there is no stronger message than for those girls to be found. Cost of government The cost of running Nigeria is obscene. The federal wage bill, at $9 billion, currently outstrips the expected revenue from crude oil sales and Nigeria's current budget deficit stands at $5 billion, despite more than three years of crude oil prices averaging over $100 a barrel. The salary for 469 federal legislators stands at $750 million. It sounds like a cliche, but it is no less true -- simply cutting the obscene amounts we spend on 'public service' will help Nigeria with more money for the things that truly matter -- regenerating industry, creating jobs, unloading the power sector, social security, saving. Entrepreneurs matter I am an entrepreneur, and I know that it's incredibly hard to be one in this country. There is no access to finance, there's multiple-taxation and a crippling patronage system that relies on endorsements and kickbacks. We lack systems that enable us to truly unlock wealth and sustain growth for entrepreneurs. Nigeria is lucky to have a proven entrepreneurial energy proven in new-industry addition (over $552 billion) to our GDP, and a massive influx of foreign direct investment. It is time for our government to actually connect with the aspiration of an eager youth population that's fired up and ready to go. As we say in Nigeria, time is going.  </corpo>

Ear-splitting, pulse-pounding and overwhelming, Egypt's capital is an all-out assault on the senses -- 18 million hustling, bustling people packed into one heaving city along the banks of the Nile. Egyptians call it the "Mother of the World," and it's not hard to see why. Cairo is a modern megalopolis with an ancient past -- a living, breathing and sweating testament to city's thousand-year old role as the main nerve center of the Arab world. But enough out of us -- we asked you to finish the following sentence: "You know you're in Cairo when..." ... and boy did you answer.

            <cabecalho>Boko Haram victim: I'll keep my captor's baby - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>"Um Haleema" was kidnapped by Boko Haram and forced into marriage. She escaped, but returned to her village pregnant and has been stigmatized as a result.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Um Haleema was just 16 years old when she was kidnapped. Her first few months in captivity, at the hands of militant group Boko Haram, were enough to break anyone's spirit -- let alone that of a teenage girl so far from home. She was captured trying to escape, along with three of her friends, as Boko Haram burned and ransacked her village. During her captivity, Um Haleema was forced to watch men, women and children slaughtered. She was forced into marriage. Forced to wait on a "husband" she hated. But while she watched, she says she was also waiting -- for a chance to break free. And after six long months, it finally came. "I had planned my escape from the beginning," she says. "There was a time my husband spent two weeks away, so I attempted to escape but guards returned me and beat me." Eventually, her captors' vigilance began to slip and she managed to escape. In her fear, all she remembers is walking for what felt like days until she finally reached safety. She arrived home to discover that her father had been killed by the same Boko Haram militants who had held her captive for almost a year. She also found she had become pregnant by her Boko Haram husband. Now, seven months along in her pregnancy, she has agreed to speak to CNN on the condition that we conceal her identity and change her name. She doesn't want to become the face of a growing crisis -- girls and women brutally victimized by Boko Haram. The fear, she says, is still with her. This time, though, it's the men in her own community she is scared of. "People in this village are rejecting me because of the pregnancy," she says. "Some will be happy to have me dead. Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion." It's an option she refuses to contemplate, even though she says local men have let it be known they will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them. She says they have threatened to kill both her and her baby. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies and government officials have told CNN that an alarming percentage of girls rescued from Boko Haram have returned pregnant. The UNFPA, which is working in camps for Nigeria's internally displaced, reports that 214 women in the camps are visibly pregnant, but it is still assessing how many got pregnant while being held by Boko Haram, and if there are still more in the earlier stages of pregnancy. "We do not know yet the total number of pregnant girls among those rescued," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a report. "The screening is still ongoing." UNFPA said it is working to meet the medical, physical and psychological needs of the freed women. In recent months, Nigeria's military has raided several Boko Haram bases freeing captive women and children. In late April to early May, about 700 women and girls were rescued in separate operations. On hearing that her daughter had been abducted, Um Haleema's mother says she immediately feared the worst. "Anybody captured by Boko Haram is presumed dead," she explains. "They abducted my step-daughter‎ and my daughter. They took a total of seven girls from this house." She says she has heard of many mothers who felt that abortion was the only option they had, but insists it's not a risk she's willing to take with her daughter. "We heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby," she says. "The girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone." Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge CNN spoke to the men Um Haleema accused of threatening her in her village. Part of a local vigilante group, they denied making the threats. The vigilante groups in the north of Nigeria -- men who take up arms to protect their communities from Boko Haram -- have long been used by the Nigerian government in an auxiliary capacity to fight against the militants. Their leader agreed to speak CNN. "I am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them," he said. "If any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes." In Muslim communities, pregnancy outside of marriage is often seen as illegitimate, unless the mother can prove it was against her will. When the interview ended and the camera stopped rolling, the vigilante leader said that his group didn't believe Um Haleema had been forced into marriage and said that she and her unborn child will always be viewed with suspicion. But he refused to comment on what he and his men might do about it. Regardless of what others say, surviving both abduction and escape has made Um Haleema realize that she has the strength to see this through. Her child, she says, deserves to live.

            <cabecalho>Koa Bosco: Italy's 'Miracle' team of African migrants - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The soccer players of Koa Bosco have become accustomed to racial taunts. But this team of African migrants playing in Italy has the best response: Winning.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The insults are crude, but they hit home hard. Shi**y African. Shi**y black people. The players of Koa Bosco have suffered many such racial taunts since their football club was formed in 2013. On occasion, physical violence has even flared on the pitch, says the Italian team's manager Domenico Mammoliti. "The ignorance of some people..." he sighs, revealing a hint of exasperation at the abuse he says his players have endured. Life in the Italian lower leagues is clearly tough. Yet it's nothing compared to the journey undertaken by this team of African immigrants and refugees from countries such as Ghana, Senegal, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Mali, the Ivory Coast, Togo and Sudan. Many risked their very existence crossing the Mediterranean Sea on rickety boats, often fleeing war, poverty and persecution in search of a better life in Europe. The U.N. Refugee Agency estimates that more than 3,500 people perished making the same journey in 2014. This year, 1,850 are believed to have died out of roughly 100,000 people who have attempted the crossing. And for most of those who do make it, life in Europe is hardly a paradise of milk and honey. Work away from the football pitch for most Koa Bosco players consists of picking fruit on farms for a paltry wage, Mammoliti said. And they are the ones lucky enough to find employment.  Koa Bosco midfielder Almani Camara, originally from Gambia, told CNN that he arrived in Italy after boarding a smugglers' boat in Libya. Camara said he risked the trip as he "doesn't hear any gunfire" or "see any dead people" in Europe as he did in Libya. His vessel was crammed full of people from all over Africa and had to be rescued after running into what he describes as "difficulties." The journey, he admits, could have easily have ended in tragedy -- yet still the migrants flock to Europe. CNN's Christiane Amanpour witnessed a packed boat intercepted by the Italian navy close to the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa only last month. One person had died after suffocating on the ramshackle wooden boat while three people had to be medevaced off. Such horrors all too familiar to the players of Koa Bosco. But the last few weeks have provided a welcome distraction from harder times and memories of struggles elsewhere. After just two years of existence, the team based in the southern town of Rosarno -- situated in the toe of Italy's geographical "boot" -- achieved promotion from the bottom tier of the country's football league pyramid. It was a triumph so unlikely that Mammoliti said he's still trying to convince himself it actually happened. "I had one of the greatest emotions of my life," he says. "It was a true miracle." For Camara, it was a victory forged in togetherness and teamwork against an adversity that went way beyond sporting competition. "They tried to fight some of our players," he said of the sides Koa Bosco faced over the course of the season. "(But) to win made us very happy." Koa Bosco will now play in the non-professional Segunda Categoria which comprises higher caliber teams from the wider Calabria region. The Segundo lies seven levels below Serie A, Italy's top division. Although there may still be a long way to go reach the likes of Juventus, AC Milan, Roma, Lazio and Internazionale, the success marks an incredible beginning for what is essentially a church team.  The club was founded by Mammoliti, his colleague Domenico Bagala and a priest named Don Roberto Meduri before entering the Italian Football Federation last year. Its aim was to bring attention to the plight of migrants arriving in Italy. Rosarno itself has experienced its fair share of racial tensions in recent years. In 2010, days of rioting followed the shooting of an African migrant. In the hours and days after, many migrants were evacuated from the area. CNN even reported that a van was touring Rosarno blaring out the message: "Any black person who is hiding in Rosarno should get out. If we catch you, we will kill you." Koa Bosco's achievement is all the more notable given this history, not to mention the legacy of troubles faced by the players in their home countries. "They (the players) don't know the language very well," Mammoliti says. "They don't have means of sustaining themselves or making enough money. "Many of them come (to Europe) for family reasons, because they were poor, because of wars in their own countries or because of some sort of struggle with the Islamic laws or the tribes that were in control of their territories." Support has come from a number of people in the local community who have followed the team home and away, often donating money and food. But Mammoliti explains that Rosarno's response to Koa Bosco hasn't always been positive. Although there are many who applaud what they have done, others "have reacted with ignorance." This continuing battle has led Mammoliti to step down as manager of Koa Bosco and help set up another new club that aims to field African migrants and local players together. Mammoliti sees many similarities between the people of Calabria and migrants from Africa. "Our kids have no work, no hope," he says. "They expatriate to find something more promising." Calabria is already one of the most depressed regions in Italy. Unemployment reached 23.4% in 2014, according to data collated by Eurostat, ensuring the influx of new arrivals from Africa has put further strain on the region's social fabric. Mammoliti hopes the new club, which he says will be called San Michel and has been founded alongside another local priest named Don Gaudioso, will help preach a message of tolerance and integration among the people of Rosarno and beyond.  "Together we can get to the goal of ... putting the local kids and the Africans together in a group," he says. "They (migrants) are paying the price of disinformation and ignorance because Italy is in the middle of severe crisis and we blame the black man." Mammoliti's words are indicative of the wider political debate regarding immigration currently raging across Europe. Some even suggest Europe has a historical debt given the often brutal colonial record of Britain, France, Germany and Italy in Africa. There's almost certainly more to this complex, multi-layered issue than that. Yet geographic location puts Rosarno, Calabria and Italy on the front line like few other places when it comes to dealing with the consequences. As such, showing tolerance and creating an example of understanding between communities which others can follow will continue to be the primary goal for the founders and management of Koa Bosco. Even more so than performing another miracle by rising up further through the Italian leagues. Do you have any inspiring football stories?

            <descricao>An Egyptian court sentenced 11 men to death for involvement in deadly Port Said riots in 2012 that left more than 70 dead, according to Egyptian state TV.</descricao>
            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court sentenced 11 men to death Tuesday for their involvement in the worst soccer violence in Egypt's history, according to a broadcast on Egyptian state TV. More than 70 people, some of them children, were killed on February 1, 2012, when fans rioted at a soccer game in the northeastern city of Port Said. Fans of the hometown Al-Masry club stormed the field after securing a win over Cairo's Al-Ahly club. Horrified witnesses described how police officers stood by and watched as rival fans attacked one another with rocks, knives and swords. The 11 sentenced to death in a retrial of the case were connected to Al-Masry. They will be able to appeal their sentences, state media reported. Forty other people received prison sentences in the case. The morning after the riots, the stadium looked like a scene from a horror film, with blood splattered on seats and walls. Dozens of shoes were left near a gate ripped from its hinges by the pressure of a surging crowd trying to escape. Al-Ahly fans blamed police for what happened. The head of the Port Said security directorate and head of maritime police both received five-year sentences over the deadly violence. After the Port Said incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games, and teams played in nearly empty stadiums. Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported. Unfortunately, Egypt remains no stranger to soccer violence. Last February, 19 people were killed in a crush involving Zamalek club soccer fans. Authorities blamed the deaths on ticketless fans who tried to push their way in to the game. But Zamalek fans painted a different picture, saying on social media that they were tear gassed as they tried to pass through a single, narrow gated entrance.

            <descricao>Merging technological advancement and medicine has always gone hand-in-hand. Here are 5 startups shaking up healthcare in Africa. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in rural areas, accessing a health clinic isn't always as simple as it should be. Poor roads can mean a trip to the doctor could be a days-long journey. As a result, several start-ups have launched that bring medical advances directly into the home -- or smartphone. Despite the huge leaps being made in the medical field in Africa, there are still an estimated 3.2 million children living with HIV, with a majority in sub-Saharan Africa. And 90% of the world's malaria fatalities also come from the region. But it doesn't mean that Africa is a lost cause. Mobile technology is emerging as a powerful ally in medical innovation on the continent. As it continues to grow at an exponential rate, a vibrant mobile health -- or mHealth -- industry is blossoming. Startups are emerging with one purpose in mind: to create tech solutions for healthcare professionals. One such company is Access Mobile, founded in Uganda by social entrepreneur Kaak Yelpaala. After years of working in the public health sector -- Yelpaala began his training at Yale University before becoming one of the early employees of the Clinton Health Access Initiative in East Africa -- he was inspired to develop his own startup providing mobile tech solutions for the industry he had become so passionate about. "Access Mobile is a company that builds software solutions for healthcare providers to better improve the health of their patients through mobile phones," he says. "Having lived in countries like Tanzania, Kenya, here in Uganda and other parts of the region, what really compelled me was believing that no matter where you live in the world you should be able to access a certin level of care. And technology plays a role in that." Cue his first software platform -- an app called Clinic Communicator designed to facilitate an easier interaction between doctors and patients in the region. The web-based platform helps medical professionals communicate with the patients through emails and SMS. Doctors are able to send messages directly to their patients and in the process tackle issues like long waiting times, unnecessary queuing, missed appointments and prescription reminders. Yelpaala is not the only tech-savvy entrepreneur using mobile technology to reach patients and provide better healthcare. To crack down on counterfeit drugs and medicines in the marketplace, former astrophysicist Bright Simons went back to Ghana and created mPedigree, a simple idea where codes are printed on prescription packaging and customers can check its legitimacy by sending a text message. Meanwhile, Cameroonian IT specialist Arthur Zang designed "Africa's first handheld medical computer tablet" last year to provide medical professionals in more rural regions to get cardiac tests results to specialists in a speedier manner. It hasn't always been smooth sailing for Yelpaala. It's been four years since he began his business and he had to provide incentives to peak interest at first. "We have started to get our first customers which has been a great milestone for us. Our first approach was to offer the product on trials and say "use this product"." He adds: "What we're finding now is that we're already starting to get traction in Kenya. We're partnering with healthcare facilities there. The thought is that we have to think very big, we have to think Pan-African, and we have to think about how we can innovate for the world." More from African Startup  </corpo>

            <descricao>Africa's leaders are starting to address the issue of 'child brides,' but is it enough?</descricao>
            <corpo>Lakshmi Sundaram is the executive director at Girls Not Brides. (CNN)Today marks the Day of the African Child. This day was created by the African Union to commemorate a tragedy -- the massacre of hundreds of children in Soweto, South Africa who were demonstrating for the basic right to a decent education. Since then, the day has been used as an opportunity to focus a global spotlight on the injustices African children face, and on the actions we all need to take to ensure they can realize their rights. This year, the theme for the day is ending child marriage in Africa, and it represents a timely call to end a practice that devastates the lives of millions of girls across the continent. We have seen promising positive commitments from the African Union and African leaders on the issue. We have also seen civil society mobilizing across the continent especially in reaching out to the communities where child marriage is prevalent. Many use the Girls Not Brides global network to amplify their voices and share lessons of what works in curbing this practice. This is crucial work since in sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of women are married as children, according to UNICEF. These girls are married off before they are physically or emotionally mature enough to become wives or mothers. Child marriage is an issue which affects girls in almost every country on the continent to a greater or lesser extent -- ten of the fifteen countries worldwide with the highest rates of child marriage are in Africa. In Niger, for example, as many as 76% of girls are married before they reach the age of 18; in Chad and the Central African Republic, it is 68%. Child marriage robs girls of their education, their health and their future. Over 60% of child brides in Africa have received no formal education whatsoever, and girls who give birth under the age of 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women who have children in their early 20s. Without major progress on this issue, the number of child brides will double by 2050 and child marriage will continue to hamper Africa's development. In fact, the persistence of child marriage has hindered Africa's efforts to achieve six of the eight Millennium Development Goals. That's why it is so crucial that we tackle child marriage head on in the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This week, the African Union is hosting a summit at which we hope African Heads of State will adopt a common African position on child marriage. Along with the SDGs, this represents a significant opportunity to ensure that commitments are quickly turned into practical national strategies and action plans that are comprehensive, well-resourced and involve all relevant actors including civil society so that the next generation of African girls can embrace a brighter, better future free from the shadow of child marriage.

            <cabecalho>The crowdfunding platform made for Africa - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>One South African company has created an ethically-conscious platform for entrepreneurs from the continent.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In the egalitarian world of crowdfunding, most sites are much the same -- largely passive templates for start-ups to vie for investment. While these tools may be advantageous abroad, in Africa... not so much. What works in New York might not necessarily work in Cape Town. Knowing this, one South African company has created an ethically-conscious platform for entrepreneurs from the continent -- and it's leaving its rivals by the wayside in the process. Thundafund, launched by Patrick Schofield in 2013, has seen unprecedented success and spawned a new way of thinking among the crowdfunding community. How? By working closely with entrepreneurs to get the best out of their ideas. "I've seen so many failed dreams," Schofield explains. "People have put their hearts and souls into businesses, their life savings into an idea they think is awesome, only to find out marketers don't like it." But with Thundafund "you actually get to ask the market whether it's a good idea." This in essence is the modus operandi for all crowdfunding sites, and Schofield is forthcoming in his praise for the "fantastic" Kickstarter and Indigogo. Thundafund is different however, explains Jaco Kruger, Managing Director of YBike, who launched a campaign attracting 50,000ZAR ($4,100) of investment in 2013. "Kickstarter doesn't really work in South Africa... it's a difficult market to break in to... It could be said [Kickstarter] is more about making money than empowering people; there's no responsibility towards funding more entrepreneurs. Patrick is providing opportunities and helping communities."  Good ideas are "a dime a dozen" Schofield says, but many South Africans lack the "the skills and resources" to bring their idea through to fruition. New businesses that do receive funding are often saddled with heavy debts or give away significant portions of their company to investors in return for guidance. Whilst the likes of Kickstarter "stand aside" once a campaign is launched according to Kruger, Thundafund has guided its entrepreneurs through the process, optimizing their chance of attracting investors. This involves utilizing multimedia channels and social networks. Schofield stresses the importance of embedded videos as a means of articulating a project's vision, but says online platforms are far from the only path. One campaign in a small community with low levels of internet uptake, reached its funding target by holding talks in the local church and library. "It's not all digital and straightforward," Schofield explains. Indeed, over a third of Thundafund's investors used bank transfers to make pledges. With that in mind the company has limited its scope to national entrepreneurs.  Over 1,400 projects have been submitted so far, with 160 finding their way on to the site. The reason behind the cull is largely due to projects realizing "they're not financially viable" during the collaborative process with Thundafund, Schofield says, or coming to the conclusion that more work needs to be done to make them so. He admits however some shrewd business decisions needed to be made on his part: "We wanted to show that crowdfunding can be successful in South Africa, and to do that we needed success stories." Amongst those is Honest Chocolate, who raised 70,000ZAR ($6,000) to turn their industrial raw chocolate business into a boutique café and shop. "Without the investment it would have been very difficult," explains co-owner Anthony Gird, "we had so many things to put it towards." Key to their campaign was the effective use of incentives for investors, among them chocolate workshops. "Seven months after our launch two people came in saying they'd come to claim their reward for investing. The campaigns have longevity as well." Both Gird and Kruger acknowledge that as well as finance, the crowdfunding process is a fantastic marketing opportunity. "It creates a build up and awareness... your target market is already activated," says Honest Chocolate's co-owner, whilst Y-Bikes, already an established company, "did very well" out of their campaign. Not that the process is easy. "You can't just post and forget about it," Kruger explains. "It's a lot of work," says Gird, "a lot of admin, a lot of bookkeeping... keeping the energy going and keeping people informed." With businesses like Honest Chocolate and Y-Bikes among the 70% of projects achieving sufficient funding, Thundafund has seen plenty of success. In comparison, Kickstarter stands at around 40%, whilst Indigogo's is less than 5%. "There's been a few crowdfunding sites in South Africa that have failed," Kruger says, "and Patrick has made this work. He's building it slow, the way it should be built."  Now that the viability of the platform has been established, Schofield is looking forward to reducing the percentage of successful campaigns and increasing the democratization of the crowdfunding process. But where will that leave South Africa's fledgling start-ups? Schofield has recently launched Ripple, a platform dedicated to community causes and activism. Such campaigns had a strong presence on Thundafund, including the solar powered Sunshine Cinema and one of Schofield's favourites, The Secret Love Project, which manufactured waterproof outfits for Cape Town's homeless, who then had the opportunity to send a message back to their investor. Schofield concedes however that "it can be a bit difficult when you have a charity project sitting next to a business project within the same space," hence the schism. South African entrepreneurs should be far from concerned by the shake-up. In fact, it looks like there will be even more support on the horizon. The two crowdfunding sites will be advised by the Africa Centre, which Schofield describes as "a supportive network for social entrepreneurship... a space for people to ask questions and receive advice," as well as "workshops and one-to-one mentorships." As Kruger says, Schofield is not just a businessman but a tutor within the crowdfunding sector and "that's unique, that's brilliant."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Why this year's Venice Biennale is all about Africa - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>This year's biennale has a distinctly African flavor as artists representing nations from the continent continue to become visible on the global stage.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's the glittering jewel that tops the contemporary art calendar every two years -- yes, the Venice Biennale is back. Often described as the "Olympics of the art world," this year 53 countries will come together at venues scattered amid the city's sprawling canals to showcase works that exemplify each artist's homeland. The prestigious exhibition opened Saturday and is a mammoth affair running for seven months until November 22. This year's biennale has a distinctly African flavor as artists representing nations from the continent continue to become increasingly visible on the global stage. But that's not the only reason the buzz at this year's edition is all about Africa.  Continuing in a long line of esteemed custodians overseeing the biennale (including Massimiliano Gioni, Robert Storr and Francesco Bonami), Nigerian Okwui Enwezor was announced as the curator for this year's exhibition back in 2013. He is the first African curator in the exhibition's 120-year history and Enwezor will continue to challenge the zeitgeist to bring African artists to the forefront. The Nigerian curator, writer and poet is a formidable powerhouse in contemporary art. His breakthrough came in 1996 when he curated "In/Sight: African Photographers, 1940 to Present" -- an exhibit of 30 African photographers at the Guggenheim Museum -- and since then he's overseen several international art events. In addition to diversifying the list of invited artists, his choice of theme -- "All the world's futures" -- is another indication of a difference in direction for the bi-annual art extravaganza. "There is nothing to compare to what Okwui Enwezor has done in Venice this year. It is, without doubt, the first truly and positively global art show," explained Chika Okeke-Agulu, a Nigerian artist, art historian and curator who has just returned from the biennale. "After this exhibition, any supposedly international contemporary art exhibition that does not include a reasonable number of African and black artists will look so small, and utterly narrow-minded."  This year's event again sees a rise in the visibility of African artists among the 136 on display. As the art scene from the continent continues to explode, an increasing number of artists are being accepted internationally, reaffirming their growing relevance in the world stage On display through national pavilions, three African nations will be making their debut (Mozambique, Mauritius and the Seychelles) at the 56th Venice Biennale. They join returning participants Angola (the 2013 winner for the best national pavilion), Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe. One particular exhibition must-see is Ghanaian filmmaker John Akomfrah's three-screen film "Vertigo Sea," described by Okeke-Agulu as "searingly beautiful." Other stand-out works, according to Okeke-Agulu (an associate professor at the Center for African American studies at Princeton), include creations by Nigerian artist Emeka Ogboh and Congolese creative Sammy Baloji.  You'll also be able to see offerings from individual artists such as Ghana's Ibrahim Mahama as well as the hotly-anticipated "Trans-African Worldspace" from Lagos-based art collective, Invisible Borders. A presentation of African art not to be missed, over the last five years Invisible Borders coordinated road trips throughout the continent inviting visual artists to explore fresh perspectives of contemporary Africa. "Artists and writers who traveled as part of Invisible Borders did not show everyday spaces -- like markets, streets, restaurants, roads, and malls -- as places in need of repair or development," Emmanuel Iduma, director of publications at Invisible Borders, wrote in a press statement. "But as places where life occurs without judgment; with mirth, theatricality, and beauty," he continued.  He's been hailed as "the most significant living African artist" and now Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui has been recognized for his monumental contributions to art. Best known for creating incredible sculptures using recycled waste, he was awarded Saturday the Golden Lion award for Lifetime Achievement in Venice. The 70-year-old artist, who was born in the small town of Anyako, eastern Ghana, now splits his time between Nigeria and his homeland. "The Golden Lion Award acknowledges not just his recent successes internationally, but also his artistic influence amongst two generations of artists working in West Africa," said Enwezor of El Anatsui.  Yet, this year's African participation was not without controversy. In Kenya, months before the biennale's opening, the awarding of the country's pavilion to Italian Paola Poponi provoked condemnation at home and abroad. The appointment was followed by an announcement that the east Africa's country's delegation would be largely comprised of Chinese artists, evoking memories of the questionable 2013 representation. Critics went on to launch petitions at the lack of Kenyans showcasing, while commentators described the controversy as embarrassing and "frightening." In Nairobi, artist Michael Soi was also caustic. "The Kenyan pavilion is basically a circus," he said. "It's come from a myriad of problems -- first of all corruption and issues of misrepresentation." Traditionally each country must submit their own application to participate in the event. But there is confusion over how much involvement the Kenyan government has had following statements made by Hassan Wario, the country's minister of culture, sports, and the arts. During a press conference on March 20, he said: "The Government of Kenya dissociates itself with this group and strongly condemns their acts of impersonation." While it remains unclear why six out of eight artists representing the east African nation are from China, due to mounting displeasure surrounding the pavilion, Italian media has reported the pavilion will remain on display as scheduled but it will no longer carry the country's name and flag.

            <cabecalho>Congo: painting colonial brutality in the DRC  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Congo's turbulent history is documented in a new art exhibition.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In front of a white building, with a Belgian flag flying high in the yard, a black man in a striped t-shirt and shorts is being strangled with a chain. Nearby, another black man is lying face down on the ground, his trousers pulled down to reveal deep bleeding cuts in his buttocks. Above him stands another black man, smartly dressed in a colonial police officer's uniform, whip raised above his head, ready to strike. The guard looks furtively over at a white man, in a white uniform with the Belgian flag sewn into his lapel, and a white pith helmet on his head. He smokes a pipe and has one hand in his pocket. His other hand casually directs the violence in the yard. This scene is from one of the paintings in a new exhibition, 53 Echoes of Zaire, which opens on 27 May at the Sulger-Buel-Lovell gallery in London. The painting, titled "Congo Belge II," was made in the 1970s and depicts a period in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (previously know as Zaire), a former Belgian colony. The Kingdom of Kongo rose in the 1300s, and part of it became Congo Free State, the private holding of Belgian King Leopold II, in the 1880s. Speaking of that colonial history, Christian Sulger-Buel, who co-founded the gallery says: "Belgian Congo is an extraordinary exception to the colonial norm. It was dramatically exploited by one man, King Leopold (II), who treated the people and the land like his private property. He owned Congo the way you'd own your car."  The artist, T. Kalema, was part of a group that came to be known as the "Lubumbashi Movement," artists living and working in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi. The work of the Lubumbashi Movement served as a way to document Congo's turbulent history. The political nature of the art created in Lubumbashi in the 1970s is particular to the city, which is the copper mining heartland of Congo. "In Kinshasa (the capital of the DRC) the subjects of art were typically social, lighter and with a lot of humor," says Salimata Diop, head of programs at London's Africa Centre, and the exhibition's curator. By contrast, artists who were part of the Lubumbashi Movement painted scenes from the slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, through to the brutality by the colonial masters and right up to their contemporary struggles: miners strikes, independence, the secession of Katanga, and hope in Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba that turns to despair as he's arrested and later killed. "These artists were not making 'airport art' -- art for foreigners or tourists to buy," says Diop. "They saw themselves as artisans and were making art for local people." Among these visual historians in Lubumbashi a sub-genre called "Colonie Belge" became popular. "These paintings typically depict a white man -- the colonial master -- impeccably dressed, doing nothing except watching a black man flog another black man, often while his family look on," explains Sulger-Buel. The images are striking not just for their graphic content but also for their use of color, a remarkable achievement considering the poverty in which the artists lived. "They had access to only basic primary colors and despite the fine lines in some of the paintings, only worked with large brushes," says Sulger-Buel.  Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu, the lead artist in the exhibition with over 30 works, had aspirations to be a teacher but became an artist. He was already prolific when he met Etienne Bol, a Belgian man his age with whom he struck up a friendship. Between 1971 and 73, Bol commissioned Kanda-Matulu and four other artists to paint the images displayed in the exhibition. Diop says: "Paintings (usually created on canvasses made from flour sacks) sold for very modest sums. Kanda-Matulu lived in a small one bedroom house and found it difficult to make a living from his art. He was very poor." Despite his contribution to popular Congolese art, Kanda-Matulu's life is shrouded in mystery. He met Etienne Bol in 1972, 10 years later, in 1982, he disappeared. People he knew thought he had gone back to his village, others speculated that he may have moved to neighboring Zambia. Given the political nature of his art, could his disappearance have been politically motivated? Diop doesn't think so but says: "Tshibumba was easy to find -- he was always working from home. But suddenly, he wasn't there anymore. In the troubled times (under the autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko) it was not uncommon for people to move a lot in search of a peaceful life. We don't know if he's alive or dead." The exhibition, which closes on June 30, the day Congo gained independence from Belgium 55 years ago, is overall a portrayal of what Sulger-Buel calls "the demons of Africa -- forced labor, civil war, violent repression of student protests," which still haunt Congo today. Whether seen as a retelling of the past or a perspective on its present day, the art and artists of the Lubumbashi Movement deserve a place in Congo's national history and on the global art scene.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Police thwarted an attack at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday, killing two of three armed assailants, the country's Interior Ministry said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Two assailants were killed and one injured in a thwarted attack at Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday morning, authorities said. The attackers confronted security officials at Karnak with firearms and explosives, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement. The three men, who were in a car, tried to enter the temple's parking lot when a plainclothes policeman forced it to stop, Egypt's Tourism Ministry said. Security forces confronted them, and two were killed: one died when he detonated the explosives he was carrying, and another was shot in the head, the Interior Ministry added. The third militant was injured. Egypt's Health Ministry said in a statement that five people were injured, including civilians. "The policeman who stopped the vehicle sustained minor injuries, but due to his heroic actions, many other potential victims were saved and thankfully no tourists were harmed," Tourism Minister Khaled Rami said. Typically, thousands of tourists visit Luxor and Karnak Temple daily. After the attack, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered an intensified security presence at vital sites in the country, including sites of antiquity, el-Sisi's office told CNN. Egypt's minister of antiquity and minister of tourism were in Luxor on Wednesday to assess the situation. This is the first deadly attack on a Luxor tourist site since 1997, when gunmen killed 62 people -- most of them international tourists.  The recent targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by Islamist militants in Egypt. Last week, gunmen shot and killed two police officers in an attack a few hundred meters from the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Interior Ministry said. Previously, militants, including the ISIS-aligned Ansar Beit Al Maqdis, mostly targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces. But four people were killed and 14 wounded when Ansar Beit Al Maqdis targeted a bus of South Korean tourists traveling from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into Israel in February 2014. Militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013. Recently, they expanded their targets to include judges. Wednesday's attack coincided with the signing of the African Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Several African leaders, including el-Sisi, are attending the summit in the Sinai Peninsula, hundreds of kilometers away from the site of Wednesday's attack. In a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to "resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime" and asserted the "legitimate right to self-defense." Security forces have arrested anyone belonging to or accused of working with the Brotherhood, a group designated by Egypt as a terrorist organization. Hundreds of Islamists and their supporters have been killed in the crackdown.  The Egyptian government has been trying to lure back tourists for the summer high season. Tourism represents 11.3% of Egypt's gross domestic product and 19.3% of its foreign currency revenues, Egypt's State Information Services says. "The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country," said Rami, the tourism minister. "We have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites, and we continue to take every possible measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>10 budget airlines changing Africa's skies - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Traveling across Africa's huge distances used to be expensive and involve tedious connections through Europe. That's finally changing.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Traveling across Africa's huge distances can be expensive. Not that long ago, getting from one city to another often meant a connection in Europe. That's finally changing. Low-cost airlines are taking off across the region, serving routes that cater to the continent's growing middle class. It hasn't been easy for them. African nations signed an "open skies" agreement in 1988, similar to the one in Europe that cleared the way for successes like easyJet. Most countries have yet to actually implement the agreement. But as the number of potential travelers grows, the new low-cost airlines are slowly convincing governments about the benefits of increased air travel. "There are more than one billion people on the African continent, which is home to just 3% of the world's aviation business," says Ed Winter, CEO of Tanzania-based fastjet. "It is clear that the continent remains in desperate need of improved and affordable aviation connectivity." There's a long list of failed ventures -- Velvet Sky and 1time in South Africa both went bust in 2012. Fly540 scrapped its flights to Accra and Luanda last year. But that's not deterring new operators. 1time hopes to reboot itself this year. Nigeria's Arik Air is looking into creating a low-cost carrier. Blue Crane, an aviation consulting firm in South Africa, hopes to start flying commercial passengers later this year, too. Here are 10 airlines already pushing Africa's travel revolution:  Kulula.com took off in 2001 as Africa's first low-cost carrier. It's still one of the most successful, and the funniest. On its trademark green planes, flight attendants wisecrack through safety announcements, and they've been known to quiz passengers who don't pay attention. But the airline is serious business too. It's operated by South Africa's Comair, the local partner of British Airways. Kulula has also forged deals with Air France and Kenya Airways that have it spread to five other countries. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, East London, Windhoek, Harare, Mauritius, Victoria Falls, Livingstone, Nairobi  One of the most ambitious of the new carriers, fastjet took off in 2011 running domestic routes in Tanzania. Over the last two years it's expanded to four other countries. The airline has big experience and big backing. Its boss Ed Winter is a former executive at easyJet, which has a stake in the African venture. The airline has set its sights on cracking the lucrative South African domestic market, while also negotiating new routes across the region. Cities served: Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Entebbe, Harare, Kilimanjaro, Lusaka, Mbeya, Mwanza  More than any other airline, flyafrica.com has stepped into the void left by the shrunken Air Zimbabwe. With Johannesburg as its hub, flights started last year with jaw-dropping specials like 99-rand ($9) trips to Victoria Falls. In addition to that popular run, it also flies the normally pricey route to Harare -- to the relief of the hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans living in South Africa. But those cheap tickets don't include any checked bags. Cities served: Johannesburg, Harare, Victoria Falls and Windhoek  Its distinctive orange planes fly mostly within South Africa, plus the holiday spice island Zanzibar. Mango is known for flash sales, with big rebates for fliers who join its mailing list and are willing to book instantly. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, George, Zanzibar  One of the newest competitors within South Africa, FlySafair took off in October and has been trying to build a customer base over established rivals Kulula and Mango. It made a big show of lowering its ticket prices this year to reflect cheaper fuel costs. The tickets are already stripped down -- they don't include checked bags. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, George  Here's an airline that shows both the incredible possibilities and the challenges of setting up new routes across Africa. Fly540 has enjoyed success in Kenya, where its flights connect even the desert outpost of Lodwar to the rest of the country. But it had to scrap operations in Ghana and Angola in 2014. Now it focuses on Kenya and neighboring countries. Cities served: Nairobi, Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu, Lamu, Lodwar, Malindi, Juba, Zanzibar  The budget airline was launched in 2014 by Kenya Airways and only serves four cities, but aviation authorities have cleared the way for JamboJet to operate flights across Africa from Nairobi and Mombasa. Cities served: Nairobi, Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu  Once a troubled name in African aviation, this carrier was shut down over the 2012 crash that killed 153 people in Lagos. Dana Air resumed flying a year ago and says all safety concerns have been addressed. It's still working on getting certified by the international aviation authority IATA, but has resumed domestic routes. Cities served: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Uyo  Although clearly not based in Africa, the airline connects 12 cities on the continent, if passengers don't mind a layover in Dubai. FlyDubai added six cities in 2014, and this year was inaugurating a new flight to Hargeisa in Somaliland. Cities served: Addis Ababa, Alexandria, Bujumbura, Dar es Salaam, Djibouti, Entebbe, Juba, Khartoum, Kigali, Kilimanjaro, Port Sudan, Zanzibar  This new carrier has just started selling tickets for its maiden flight between Johannesburg and Cape Town, scheduled for March 5. The airline is a reboot for the shuttered 1time, whose top executives are behind the new venture. Among their bragging rights: no charges for checked luggage. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town.

            <descricao>In Cameroon, a fon, or king, can inherit wives from his predecessor. Meet the women who make the man.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Abumbi II, the 11th fon, or king, of Bafut, Cameroon, has close to 100 wives. They weren't all his to start. According to local tradition, when a fon dies, his successor inherits all his wives and then marries his own queens. "The queens have a great role to play in the fondom," notes Prince Nickson, also of Bafut, noting that it is up to these women behind the man to shape him in his kingly role. "Behind every successful man must be a very successful, staunch woman," says Abumbi's third wife, Queen Constance. "Our tradition has it that when you are king, the elderly wives remain to hand down the tradition to the younger wives, and also to teach the king the tradition because the king had been a prince, not a king." Despite the fact that polygamy is legal in Cameroon, the data shows that there are far fewer polygamous marriages across the African continent. The practice is being challenged by changing values, the spread of the Christian faith, the growing appeal of the western way of life but also the rising costs of having large families. It is against this backdrop that Cameroon's traditional rulers must walk the fine line between two often conflicting cultures. "During colonialism other values came in, of governance, different from the traditional values we had and therefore there is this constant conflict between the traditional values and modern western values," admits Fon Abumbi II, who has ruled Bafut, the largest fondom in the region, for 47 years. "My role is to blend them, to find the way forward so my subjects can enjoy the fruits of development and modernity without destroying their culture. Without a culture, you are not a human being, you are an animal. And therefore the chieftaincy institution is the guarantor of our culture." Though polygamy is often met with criticism in the West, there are some who deem it a valuable tradition. After meeting with Fon Abumbi II, Soni Methu, presenter for CNN's Inside Africa, noted that there was more to the practice than meets the eye: "I understand that we might be quick to judge the lifestyle of the kings, but just like in the United Kingdom, African kingdoms and kings are bound to a rich culture and history. (Practices) like inheritance of all your father's wives is nothing but a moral obligation." She also observed that many of these royals are highly accomplished. On meeting the queens of Fon Ndofua Zofia II of Babungo -- one of Cameroon's youngest traditional rulers -- Methu said: "All his young wives, forced on him by tradition, spoke fluent English in a French-speaking region and were great marketers." It is this seeming contradiction that makes life in the fondom fascinating and confusing. Are they stuck in the past or keeping pace with the present? Fon Zofoa III doesn't think you have to choose. He may have "inherited" 72 wives and more than 500 children after his father's death, but he considers himself a very modern king. "To run a kingdom nowadays in this era, you must be educated because things are moving very fast. Like they used to say, education is light, ignorance is darkness."

            <descricao>An airstrike in Libya killed key terror figure Mokhtar Belmokhtar, Libyan officials said.  U.S. officials have not confirmed Mokhtar was killed.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)U.S. planes carried out a strike inside Libya on Sunday, reportedly killing a key terror figure in North Africa, U.S. and Libyan officials said. The target was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran Islamist fighter, who is blind in one eye, affiliated with al Qaeda in North Africa, a U.S. official told CNN. The Libyan government said Belmokhtar was killed in the strike, something that U.S. officials have not confirmed. Federal prosecutors in New York had charged Belmokhtar in 2013 with crimes related to a brazen attack on a gas facility in Algeria were 37 hostages died. Three Americans were among the dead. Two F-15 fighter jets dropped multiple 500-pound bombs on a hardened structure in the center of a compound, multiple U.S. defense officials told CNN. U.S. aerial intelligence assets were tracking Belmokhtar's movements at the time of the raid, a Pentagon official with direct knowledge of the operation told CNN, but the outcome of the operation was still being assessed. The initial indication was that Belmokhtar had been killed, the U.S. officials said, but they still lacked an absolute confirmation. The Libyan government went further in a statement Sunday, saying that the U.S. airstrike "led to the killing of Moktar Belmokhtar and a group of Libyans who are members of a terrorist organization in Eastern Libya." The strike happened at 2 a.m. Sunday (8 p.m. ET Saturday). In New York, Belmokhtar was charged on various conspiracy counts including hostage-taking, kidnapping, providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.  Belmokhtar is the founder of the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, also known as the al-Mulathamun Battalion. The group claimed responsibility for the January 2013 attack in Algeria. In the Algerian siege, heavily armed militants in pickups struck a sprawling state-owned natural gas complex near In Amenas, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. Belmokhtar had said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. The Algerian military tried to negotiate with the militants during the standoff, but their demands to release militants held prisoner in Algeria were deemed unreasonable, leading to intervention by special forces troops. The gas facility operated in cooperation with foreign energy firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP -- and as such, employed workers from several Western countries.

            <descricao>The Econet Wireless telecommunications group was founded in Zimbabwe in 1993. CNN's Zain Asher spoke to its chairman and founder, Strive Masiyiwa.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Strive Masiyiwa, who set up his Econet Wireless company in Zimbabwe in 1993, believes the world is on its way to being connected "in ways we never imagined." Masiyiwa's company is not only playing its part in the constant growth in cellphone use in Africa, it also does vital work in establishing the technological networks that enable that to happen. He explains to Marketplace Africa host Zain Asher why he thinks that, amongst other things, this revolution can "democratize" education across the continent. Zain Asher: What is the future of mobile data? Strive Masiyiwa: The amount of data usage that has taken place globally in the last two years is greater than all the global data usage in the history of humanity. This is only going to increase, and Africa is not going to be left behind or outside it. The world is too connected now, so we are going to see far greater data usage, far more devices and appliances connected... we are going to be connected in ways that we never imagined. ZA: Mobile is the big buzzword. Where does your company stand in this explosion of growth? SM: We are active in about 17 African countries, and we are active across a broad spectrum of technologies. We are involved in the cellphone industry but also in building much of infrastructure that support the networks themselves. We are the biggest builder of fiber in Africa -- we build 100km a week of fiber across Africa. Many people don't realize that for you to be able to get a smartphone to work, you need a lot of bandwidth. The networks buy that bandwidth from us... all the big mobile network operators in Africa buy that capacity from one of our companies. We have also got to lay out infrastructure for new technologies like 3G, 4G and so forth. Then we have to ensure that there's smartphone penetration. We have to ensure that prices are coming down but also sufficiently attractive for investors who are putting the capital up front. It's give and take. ZA: Many parts of Africa are going to go from having no internet to having internet via mobile and wireless. What does that mean for the continent and its development? What does the future look like? SM:: Pretty exciting. For a start, opening up access to the internet attracts opportunities. Sixty percent of our population in Africa is under the age of 30, which means there's a lot of young people and they need education. We don't have the resources or time to put up your traditional brick and mortar schools. We have over 30 million kids who should be in school who are not even in primary school. If we can harness the technological platforms that are available, the tools that are there now, we can leapfrog some of the costs and, as I like to put it, democratize education. Why should a child in the capital of a country not have access to exactly the same quality of education as someone in the rural areas? If you create platforms around the internet you can achieve that. So we will gain access, but we cannot say it is a panacea for all our problems. Technology is only a tool. It's only as good as we are able to use it.

            <descricao>A smuggler boat captain who trafficks children into Europe explains why he does and why he blames the kids' parents.</descricao>
            <corpo>Burj Mughayzil, Egypt (CNN)On a sandy beach in one of the many inlets dotting Egypt's Mediterranean coastline two men are standing off to one side watching us interview families whose children have been trafficked into Europe. Eventually the taller of them begins to jump in. He starts shouting and explaining why he works on the smuggler boats carrying the human cargo into Europe. "What does the government do for us? We're fishermen but there's nothing to catch." The village, Burj Mughayzil, is essentially a smugglers' village. By their own count 2,000 young men and boys have disappeared. Some as young as 11 and 12, they are lured by the European dream -- but so many of them either end up in Italian jails accused of crewing the smuggling ships or killed in the crossing. We were hoping somewhere on the beach to find a crewman on a smuggling ship, someone who had made the journey and returned. We found two; the tall man and his slimmer friend, who told us they were a ship's mate and a captain. When I asked if they'd talk on camera they agreed. To our surprise they both asked to show their faces and to give their names. CNN has retraced the route traveled by the children from small villages on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, across the sea to Sicily by boat, then making their way to the Italian capital, Rome, where they fall victim to drug and prostitution rings. Thousands of children are risking their lives, falling prey to traffickers, for the dream of a better future for them and their families. Captain Mahmoud and Mohammed told us: "We work the ships. Me and a crew of 15 people. If the [Egyptian] government was helping us in any way we wouldn't be crossing in any way." The trips can take up to nine days on the open seas. The Egyptian Government says it has increased its vigilance along the coastline but still the smugglers are finding ways out. Sometimes he says, 20 boys are crammed on a tiny fishing boat fitted with an onboard motor, so they can be brought out to sea where he and his crew wait on a bigger boat which holds up to 600 people. 'It's risky for the boat and for everyone on it. We could be sentenced to 25 years or be executed if anything happens, God forbid, to anyone on board if it becomes a death trip." He also risks years in an Italian jail on the other side and a 15,000 euro ($17,000) fine for every single person on board. The fine can stretch into the millions, Italian authorities say. It's a risk he knowingly takes. Though, the captain says, leaving him and his men "to rot in jail," is not the solution. "There are big fish and there are small fish. The small fish are the ones who are in Italian jails. The big fish live freely here in Egypt, freely in Italy." Many of the parents claim it is the children themselves who want to go -- but teens we spoke to in Italy say their families expect them to work once they get to Europe and to send money home. Others admit Europe is seen as a way of earning the family much-needed cash but they say they didn't know about the trafficker gangs behind the smuggling routes. Yet others say they were deceived by the smugglers who make empty promises of opportunity across the Med. Authorities in both countries are clear, they say the parents are guilty -- at the very least -- of abandoning their children. The smugglers, Captain Mahmoud says, are very brazen. "We leave here at dusk, dawn, whenever. It doesn't matter if you know you are risking jail anyway. We'll have been paid -- us and the crew - 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,300) each. That feeds a crewman's family and kids for a month. Then after that, who knows? Risk it again or die of hunger." Egyptian minors have been flooding into Italy by the thousands according to the Italian Ministry of Labor, taking advantage of Italian laws that grant state protection to those under 18 who arrive in Italy unaccompanied. It's not just the passengers that are underage though; his crew often is as well. Captain Mahmoud says they are pressured by their families. "People here in this village, they're selling their kids. They think, 'we're 10 [people] and we can't find enough to eat. When we're nine, we can eat a little better. If we're eight, we can eat even better still. If two get locked up? Better than we all die together.' All the people in Italian jails? They're the victims of the parents here who can't afford to eat." I asked if they felt a responsibility for the people making the crossing, for those who have died. "How can we not?" he said. "If anything happens to them, it happens to us. If the ship sinks we drown together." His tall friend, Mohammed, talks over him, "How can we not be sad? These are our cousins, our brothers. I still see their faces." At the end of the interview Captain Mahmoud asks again if we're going to broadcast this, if his government will see this. I tell him, yes, we will. Good, he says. Let them hear the truth.

            <corpo>(CNN)A Moroccan magazine has withdrawn its latest edition from the shelves after controversy over a front cover that showed two men at a swimming pool gazing into each other's eyes with the headline, "Should homosexuals be burned?" A statement released by the magazine, Maroc Hebdo (Morocco Weekly), on Friday said its decision to pull the edition -- in paper form and online -- followed "strong reactions" to it, particularly on social media. The statement, issued in the name of editor Mohamed Selhami, also apologized to anyone shocked by the subject matter. "Our publication is not a political editorial that pushes a certain sensationalism or provocative topics that can offend the public," it said. "In this instance, it wanted to show the different sides of a social fact; homosexuality and by extension its status in our society. A debate on today's agenda. Maroc Hebdo wanted in this respect to give an account of this debate." At the same time it announced the edition's withdrawal, the magazine offered "an apology to all readers who could be shocked by this topic and reminds them that it will continue working on opening up a national debate on democracy in our society and the values on which it was founded." Homosexuality is illegal the majority Muslim, North African nation. According to rights group Human Rights Watch, those convicted of homosexual acts under Moroccan law can be sentenced to up to three years in prison and a fine.

            <corpo>(CNN)Guatemala's President will be investigated in a corruption probe and could be stripped of immunity that protects him from prosecution. The Central American nation's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that President Otto Perez Molina should be investigated and asked the country's lawmakers to lift the President's immunity. The Supreme Court's ruling comes more than a month after Guatemalan Vice President Roxana Baldetti stepped down amid a customs corruption scandal. The Guatemalan Congress will name a commission that will conduct the investigation into Perez Molina, which was requested by an opposition party. A spokesman for Perez Molina said the President would respect the law as the investigation moves forward, the state-run AGN news agency reported. Perez Molina, a retired military general who campaigned on promises to use an "iron fist" to fight crime, won the presidential election in 2011. In recent months, he's faced mounting criticism at home as his Cabinet faces a slew of corruption scandals.

            <cabecalho>FIFA: The search for Jack Warner - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>CNN travels to Trinidad to track down Jack Warner, the ex-FIFA executive who promises to spill the beans on the scandal enveloping world football.</descricao>
            <corpo>Port of Spain, Trinidad (CNN)As we passed the fourth industrial complex en route from Port of Spain airport to the hotel, I was shaking my head. This just couldn't be right. Sensing the consternation, my newest friend Ramesh -- a sage taxi driver if ever you met one -- jumped in unprompted. "Most tourists get the ferry to Tobago. Trinidad is a place to do business. What brings you here?" Our business, of course, was "Mr. Warner," as Trinidadians refer to arguably the island's most notorious resident. My journey had started the previous week in Zurich after news broke of the arrests of a number of FIFA executives at dawn. Sepp Blatter was re-elected. Sepp Blatter resigned. Each day there was a new development that has woven a tapestry of allegations and revelations to touch every continent on the planet. Seemingly at the center of that tapestry was Warner. And despite his steadfast denial of any wrongdoing, there were countless questions that needed to be asked. CNN would do its best to do just that. Which was why we were getting a tour -- together with U.S.-based colleagues Robyn Curnow, Nicol Nicolson and Jose Armijo -- of Port of Spain's industrial estates. The charges against Warner are extensive. He resigned from the FIFA Executive Committee in 2011 after being accused of several counts of corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. However, after being banned from football administration worldwide, all investigations into those allegations were dropped. All that changed when Warner was one of 14 executives charged by the U.S. Justice Department over alleged racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering and bribery. The U.S. has formally requested his extradition, and judicial proceedings in Trinidad have already begun. As we crawled towards the city center, Ramesh put us on the phone to his daughter -- a local reporter, who in turn gave me two direct numbers for Warner. As it turned out, they were the same as two I had been given by a colleague in London. The chances of them being genuine suddenly seemed much more likely. Calls were made to both of the numbers. No answer, but messages were left nonetheless. A contact had also given us Warner's personal email address. Again, no reply to our request to talk to him. Warner's business interests have spread throughout Trinidad, which provided other possible avenues of inquiry. The 72-year-old owns a professional football team called Joe Public in the district of Tunapuna. He also has control of one of the island's newspapers, Sunshine, and owns a restaurant. Ramesh also told us that Warner's house was located in the Five Rivers area of Arouca -- although we would have to sniff out which one it was. Another possibility was Trinidad's Parliament. The day before we arrived, Warner -- a prominent opposition MP in Trinidad -- had been laughed at by some peers in the chamber after yet again vowing to "unleash an avalanche of evidence" to clear his name. But this being a Saturday, he wouldn't be in Parliament for another 48 hours. There was also Warner's political constituency of Chiguanas West. It was there that he had danced at a public rally only hours after being released from prison the previous week. Our driver didn't know the area well, so it took 30 minutes of circling in the heat before we located a ramshackle building with several crumbling signs outside. Next to advertisements for ultrasound testing and corrective footcare, a sign for "OFFICE OF THE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT FOR CHAGUANAS WEST" stood out imposingly. As we walked up the stairs, the office manager came out and started stonewalling us. "Is he here?" asked Robyn. "Yes, and he asks that you respect his privacy," came the reply. Warner was holding a "clinic" for his constituents -- a drop-in center where residents could talk face-to-face with their MP about local issues. Unfortunately face-to-face didn't stretch to questions about multiple allegations of serious fraud from journalists. After a couple of interviews with junior staff members and constituents, we were unceremoniously kicked out. Other broadcasters came and went, before a team from Sky News in the UK arrived to join us in the wait for Warner to leave. His car was directly outside, so he had to leave at some stage. Ultimately it was a fruitless five hours. After countless attempts to get back in, even calling through the window at one stage, we realized any faint hopes of our man deciding to talk to CNN were in vain. Warner is happy to publish rambling video messages when it suits him, but it became pretty clear that this was not a man ready to be asked questions by the media. Questions he has still never answered publicly. Warner is not a free man, though. A stipulation of his bail agreement forces him to check in at his local police station every Monday and Thursday. He cannot leave the country, and once all the evidence is presented to the Trinidadian Attorney General by the U.S. authorities, Warner will likely face an extradition hearing as soon as August. That was confirmed to us by the Attorney General the following morning. It seems likely that if Warner does have an "avalanche" of evidence, he is likely to need it in court to prove his innocence.

            <corpo>(CNN)Hurricane Blanca is churning in the Pacific toward Mexico's Baja California coast, where it is expected to make landfall. Blanca has maximum sustained winds of 175 kilometers per hour (110 mph). "The center of Blanca will approach the southwest coast of the Baja California peninsula later today and move near or along the coast tonight and Monday," the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Puerto San Andresito to Punta Abreojos. By early Sunday, Blanca was about 355 kilometers (220 miles) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, where a hurricane watch is in effect. "Maximum sustained winds have decreased ... with higher gusts," the hurricane Center said. "Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Blanca is expected to weaken to a tropical storm tonight before it reaches the southwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula." Blanca is forecast to be downgraded to a tropical depression Monday night.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Officials respond to Haiti Red Cross scandal - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The American Red Cross disputes a ProPublica and NPR account that the agency received $488 million in donations for Haiti relief but built only six homes.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The American Red Cross is disputing a news account that alleged serious shortcomings in the relief agency's aid to Haiti after the catastrophic 2010 earthquake, including how the group received $488 million in donations but built only six permanent homes. The Red Cross called the report by ProPublica and National Public Radio as lacking in "balance, context and accuracy ... which follows the pattern of all their previous Red Cross stories." "It is particularly disappointing to see our work misrepresented, considering we answered more than 100 questions in writing and provided an interview with the head of our international programs," a Red Cross statement said.  The investigative account asserted that the Red Cross faced "constant upheaval" of staff in Haiti, a "pattern" of "botched delivery of aid" and "an overreliance on foreigners who could not speak French or Creole." The Red Cross also lacked expertise to carry out its own projects in Haiti and instead gave donors' money to other groups to do the work, escalating costs of overhead and management, which in one case added up to a third of a project's budget, the news outlets said in their account published Wednesday. The outlets also cited a 2013 U.S. Government Accountability Office report that found a Red Cross-USAID partnership to build homes didn't develop "because of the delays in securing land title and because of turnover in Red Cross leadership that resulted in shifting approaches to housing in Haiti," the GAO study said. The U.S. Agency for International Development fights global poverty and promotes democracy. The Red Cross, however, said its overall programs provided clean water and sanitation in Haiti and moved "more than 100,000 people out of makeshift tents into safe and improved housing." "Despite the most challenging conditions, including changes in government, lack of land for housing, and civil unrest, our hardworking staff -- 90 percent of whom are Haitians -- continue to meet the long-term needs of the Haitian people. While the pace of progress is never as fast as we would like, Haiti is better off today than it was five years ago," the Red Cross said.  The relief agency described several of the news account's assertions as "myths." About purportedly building only six new homes, the agency said it "has provided more than 132,000 people with safe and durable housing." "When we could not secure land to provide new housing, we focused on safe housing with a wide spectrum of choices, not a one-size-fits all plan (rental subsidies, repairs and retrofitting of existing homes, as well as teaching people how to repair their homes)," the Red Cross said in a statement. The news story relied on Red Cross internal documents, field reporting in Haiti and interviews with Haitian and former Red Cross officials, including the agency's former chief of the Haitian shelter program, Lee Malany. Malany quit after agency officials "did not seem to have any idea how to spend millions of dollars set aside for housing," according to the outlets' report.  The Red Cross also declined repeatedly to disclose details on how exactly money was spent in Haiti and instead provided only broad categories of expenditures, despite a pledge by CEO Gail McGovern that her agency would "lead the effort in transparency," the news report said. A CNN review of the Red Cross' tax filings from July 2010 to June 2014 shows no detailed expenditures for its numerous relief programs, including in Haiti. Those documents, called Form 990, do show details on salaries, including McGovern's $597,961 total compensation in the most recent filing. The Red Cross said it annually reports online how donor dollars are spent according to sector and seven priorities: emergency relief, shelter, health, water and sanitation, livelihoods, disaster preparedness, and cholera prevention. Accusations that "details of Red Cross spending are so broad as to be useless" is a myth, the agency said.  The Red Cross also disputed accusations about internal problems and delayed services and asserted that staff turnover rate was "relatively low" and "consistent" with other humanitarian organizations in Haiti. The agency said 91 cents of every donated dollar goes to programs and services, and partnering organizations also have low expenses. "It is more cost effective to rely on the expertise of partners than if we tried to build and staff these programs from scratch," the Red Cross said. A 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed between 230,000 and 316,000 people in Haiti in 2010 and left 1.5 million people displaced in the immediate aftermath. A subsequent cholera outbreak killed more than 8,500 people. In all, more than $13 billion in aid has been allocated to Haiti by multilateral and bilateral agencies from 2010 to 2020, according to the U.N. Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Lionel Messi has urged his teammates to improve in Tuesday's Copa America clash with Uruguay after Argentina "fell asleep" against Paraguay. Messi's men blew a two-goal lead, drawing 2-2 in their opening Group B match of the South American championship in Chile, while titleholder Uruguay won 1-0 against guest nation Jamaica. "We played well in the first half, but we fell asleep in the second," said Messi, who scored a 36th-minute penalty soon after Sergio Aguero's opener in La Serena. Nelson Valdez reduced the deficit from long range on the hour mark and substitute Lucas Barrios snatched an equalizer in the final minute of regulation time. "We should have put the game to bed," said captain Messi, who came into the tournament after winning a treble of titles with European and Spanish champion Barcelona. "In the first half we completely dominated possession, but in the second Paraguay took the ball away from us. "Obviously it's frustrating to be held to a draw after being 2-0 up, but we have to move on, think about Uruguay and improve. We have to keep the ball a bit more and manage the game." Uruguay beat its larger neighbor Argentina on penalties in the quarterfinals on the way to winning the last Copa in 2011, but could only reach the round of 16 of the 2014 World Cup -- where Messi's side lost in the final. When they contested the World Cup qualifiers, Argentina won the home match 3-2 but lost 3-2 in Uruguay. Veteran midfielder Cristian Rodriguez netted the only goal against Jamaica in Antofagasta, as the Caribbean side acquitted itself well on debut in the tournament. Mexico is the other guest nation, making its ninth appearance. It drew 0-0 in its Group A opener against Bolivia on Friday. On Sunday, Venezuela caused a shock by beating 2014 World Cup quarterfinalist Colombia 1-0 in Rancagua thanks to a 60th-minute header from striker Jose Salomon Rondon, who plays for Russian champion Zenit St. Petersburg. Brazil was to take on Peru in the second Group C match in Temuco.  In Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifiers, titleholder Spain stayed second in Group C with a 1-0 win in Belarus. David Silva scored the only goal at the end of the first half as coach Vicente del Bosque celebrated 100 games in charge. Slovakia has a three-point advantage after six of 10 games, having beaten Macedonia 2-1 at home, while third-placed Ukraine kept alive its hopes of a top-two finish by beating Luxembourg 3-0. England stayed six points clear at the top of Group E, winning 3-2 in Slovenia thanks to a late goal from captain Wayne Rooney and a spectacular double from midfielder Jack Wilshere. Second-placed Switzerland also came from behind to win 2-1 in Lithuania, as Xherdan Shaqiri netted an 84th-minute decider. Austria maintained a four-point lead in Group G as striker Marc Janko scored the only goal away to third-placed Russia. Sweden moved four points above Russia as star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice in a 3-1 win at home to Montenegro.  In 2017 African Cup of Nations qualifiers, Emmanuel Adebayor scored both goals as Togo beat Liberia 2-1 in their Group A opener on Sunday. Ghana, the 2015 runner-up, thrashed Mauritius 7-1 in Group H, while Egypt beat Tanzania 3-0 in Group G and Cameroon snatched a late 1-0 win over Mauritania in Group M. Defending champion Ivory Coast drew 0-0 in a friendly away to Gabon. Who will win the Copa? Have your say on CNN FC's Facebook page  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Brazilian great Zico is the latest former professional footballer intent on succeeding FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Frenchman David Ginola and Portugal's Luis Figo both threw their hats into the ring ahead of last month's presidential election, only to both ultimately pull out of the race. Blatter went on to be re-elected for a fifth term, before announcing his resignation following the launch of separate investigations by the U.S. and Swiss authorities into alleged corruption within FIFA. The election of Blatter's successor is believed to be set for December, and former Brazil star Zico, whose full name is Arthur Antunes Coimbra, wants to shake up the way world football is run. "I would like to confirm the decision to be a candidate," Zico told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro. "I feel I am capable. For sure, certain rules need to change. "It's sad for our sport to see what is happening in football today -- the corruption... and the hard work of many other good people wasted. "I see it as my duty to use my experience and knowledge to try and stand for the presidency." Former France international Ginola, whose bid was controversially backed by betting company Paddy Power, withdrew from the presidential race in January after failing to receive the backing of five football federations required to stand in the election. The 48-year-old Ginola, however, has said in the wake of Blatter's resignation that he wants to put himself forward once again. Ex-Portugal captain Figo, meanwhile, pulled out just a week before the election, referring to the process as "a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man -- something I refuse to go along with." Zico, who represented his nation at three World Cups but never won the competition, admits he may also struggle to gather enough support like his fellow ex-professionals. "That need to have five federations behind you, I think that is where the corruption starts," said the Brazilian. "Of course, changes in the rules of the game would be necessary. Mainly because with the rules in place now there isn't the slightest possibility [of being elected]." Zico has little administrative experience in the world of football but said it was after speaking to Figo that he decided to stand for the role of FIFA president. "I was asked if I had talked with Figo about his being a candidate for FIFA," he said. "I said I had and that set me thinking." Considered one of Brazil's greatest ever players, Zico played most of his club football with Brazilian side Flamengo, before moving to play in Italy and Japan. The 62-year-old has also coached all over the world, taking charge of the Japan and Iraq national teams as well as the likes of Turkish side Fenerbahce and Russian club CSKA Moscow.  Meanwhile FIFA has handed over computer data to the Swiss authorities following a raid of the governing body's headquarters. Swiss authorities opened an investigation into corruption involving the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups last month. The Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) spokesperson confirmed the seizure of IT data to CNN. "Today, FIFA handed over seized IT Data to the OAG," a statement read. "As already communicated, the OAG has opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown. "The OAG is currently analyzing seized data and information. The OAG won't go into details as criminal proceedings are still under way." Reportedly Blatter is believed to be among those whose office was involved in the raid, while data from the offices of secretary general Jerome Valcke and the organization's financial chief Markus Kattner is also said to have been released to Swiss police.  Emirates CEO Tim Clark has also spoken out about his company's decision not to renew its sponsorship deal with FIFA in November. Clark said Emirates chose not to renew with FIFA because the commercial terms were not right, but added it could make a U-turn when Blatter departs and "if things are sorted out in FIFA." "We are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the fallout over the last few weeks," Clark told CNN's Richard Quest. "It is a big pity, the big loser of course is football. Let's hope we can get it back onto some kind of track, it becomes the beautiful sport that it is, the sponsors are back in competing against each other to get on the tournament, because it is a hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure, but it's worth it." A number of current FIFA sponsors have warned the governing body to clean up its act in light of the corruption scandal, while Sony last week demanded an investigation into allegations over the controversial awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Women's World Cup: Marta breaks scoring record - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Marta breaks the Women's World Cup scoring record with her 15th goal at the tournament.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)She's possibly the greatest soccer player you've never heard of. Marta has won virtually every individual and team honor available throughout her illustrious career -- and now the Brazilian has another record to add to her collection. Her penalty in Tuesday's 2-0 win over South Korea at the 2015 Women's World Cup propelled her to the top of the tournament's all-time goalscorer list with 15 goals. She surpassed retired Germany international Brigit Prinz and went two ahead of current USWNT star Abby Wambach who, at 35 years of age, is surely playing in her last World Cup. It was fitting that her record-breaking goal came from the penalty spot against South Korea, 12 years after her first for Brazil at a World Cup -- which, incidentally, was also a penalty against the same opposition. However, the one major trophy to evade the 29-year-old has been the World Cup. Widely regarded as the best female footballer of all time, can she really be considered the greatest ever without winning football's biggest prize? It is a question often asked about Argentina star Lionel Messi. Although, Marta has an international record and Ballon d'Or haul that would make even Messi's eyes water. Her goal on Tuesday took her to an incredible 92 goals in 93 matches for her country, while she has five FIFA World Player of the Year awards which came in consecutive years between 2006 and 2010. Often referred to as "the female Pele" -- and by Pele himself as "Pele with skirts" -- Marta has long been an advocate for equality in women's football. "I think it has changed a bit but that mentality still exists," she told CNN in 2013. "There's still prejudice and that resistance regarding women not only on female football but in various activities. "Men think that women are a bit fragile to perform some types of activities or don't have the ability and aren't strong enough. "That doesn't exist anymore. Women have shown they have capabilities in every sense better than men a lot of time, but it's that whole macho thing. "Football in Brazil is seen as a masculine sport, even with a lot of people accepting the female sport. There's still a percentage that thinks like in the old days." Despite there being undoubtedly a long way to go, a lot of progress has been made. In the USA, 3.3 million people tuned in to watch their team's opener against Australia, more than tripling the viewing figures from the first game at the previous World Cup. Similarly in England, television viewers peaked at 2.4 million during the country's 1-0 defeat against France, almost double the 1.3 million that watched them during the European Championship in 2013. Perhaps the most impressive figure came from the host nation Canada, whose 1.8 million viewers during their team's tournament opener against China made it the most watched Women's World Cup match ever in the country. "There is hope for the future," Marta said two years ago. With her exceptional talents and record-breaking achievements, she certainly forms a large part of that hope.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A Brazilian man crooned and strummed his guitar while undergoing brain surgery in his home country. Anthony Kullkamp Dias, 33, sang six songs while the doctors performed surgery to remove his brain tumor, according to the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceicao. Dias played "Yesterday" by the Beatles, a few Brazilian songs and an original number called "Emanuel," which he dedicated to his son. He was awake and talking during the surgery to monitor and map the brain for possible injuries to areas that control motor function and speech, which might be affected by the removal of the tumor, doctors said. In an interview with CNN affiliate TV Globo, Dias said he found out about his brain tumor a few days before his son was born. The idea to play the guitar and sing during the surgery came the day before he was wheeled into the operating room. The banker has played the guitar for 20 years, and also plays the accordion, keyboards, trumpet and the flute. Dr. Jean Abreu Machado, the anesthesiologist and clinical director at the hospital, said the brain tissue does not have sensors to pain. However, the skin and other surrounding tissue do, causing an interesting challenge to doctors on how to "keep the patient awake and pain-free." Dias said he felt no pain and they removed 90% of his tumor.    </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)It's a shame the Women's World Cup doesn't get the love the men's does. You're so missing out. The women play with a hunger that million-dollar prima donnas (read: Ronaldo) just can't always muster. The games aren't always a foregone conclusion (Long-shots like Australia can surprise you here). And your team can actually win this thing. (We're talking to you, U.S. and England). The tournament began Sunday and runs until July 5. The U.S. takes on Australia at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday. Still not convinced? Let us dispel some more doubts, so you'll give Women's World Cup a shot.  You know how some Americans complain that soccer's boring because there are so few goals? Not here. In the opener yesterday, Norway beat Thailand 4-0. And how many goals did Germany score against the goalless Ivory Coast? TEN! Yes, 10!  You know how in men's soccer, a strong wind is enough to knock a player over. And they play-act like a babies? The women don't have time for that. According to a study, women fake injury half as much as men do. And when they are on the ground rolling around, they're back up 30 seconds faster than men.  You know what the big controversy was, ahead of the 2014 men's World Cup in Brazil? In six of the 12 cities that hosted the games, the quality of the grass was poor and could really injure a player. Oh boo hoo! At least the men had grass. The women will play their games on synthetic turf. Turf burns are brutal. Legs are going to get beat up.  If you're an American, then get behind Team USA. While the men's team has made much progress, the women have won the World Cup not once (1991) but twice (1999) and came so close four years ago. Remember that iconic pic of Brandi Chastain celebrating? That was her after scoring the winning penalty kick against China, when she became every girl's soccer hero. If you're a Brit, your women's team could also make you proud (unlike Rooney and the boys). Plus, they're in a relatively easy group. And if you're German, your guys already won the men's World Cup last year. Why not make it a two-fer? Your gals are ranked #1 in the world.  We'll admit, it's hard to top Luis Suarez chomping down on an opponent. And that's a good thing in the women's game. It keeps the 'beautiful game' beautiful. But women's soccer has its share of drama. Remember this epic hair pull? Or what about when Colombia's Lady Andrade left a shiner on U.S.' Abby Wambach during the London Olympics?  Messi. Tevez. Neymar. You know them all. And you should. They're really, really good. You know who else is good? Abby Wambach. How good? Well, she's scored more goals for a national team than any other player in soccer history. And that includes women and men. Then there's Brazil's Marta, nicknamed "Pele with a skirt." Slightly sexist, we know. But it's meant as a compliment. She was named FIFA Woman's Player of the Year five times. She's yet to win a World Cup and you can bet, she'll be giving it her all.

She is a veteran of eight Olympics as the supervisor of NBC's Olympic Research Room, for which she won an Emmy in 2012. Follow her on Twitter @bassab1. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)For the past few weeks, soccer has held an unusually prominent place in U.S. headlines, although for scandal rather than action on the pitch. All the talk about bribes and politics and the squalid doings of world soccer's ruling body, FIFA, obscured a happier soccer story: Over the weekend in Canada, the elite women of the world took to the field to start the largest and longest Women's World Cup ever held -- 52 matches among 24 teams. And the American women are, as always, a top contender to take it all. The relative lack of attention paid to the Women's World Cup is no surprise. While it will take some time to see if the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter has any effect on the organization's alleged shenanigans, one thing is sure: His downfall is nothing but good for the women's game. He has never been what one would call supportive. The popularity of women's soccer has grown under his tenure, but not for reasons he ever appeared to understand. "Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball," he famously said in 2004. "They could, for example, have tighter shorts." American superstar Alex Morgan says Blatter did not know who she was at the FIFA Player of the Year awards in 2013, where she was being honored as one of the top three in the world. Teammate Abby Wambach led a gender discrimination suit against FIFA over the issue of artificial turf, something Blatter and his cronies basically ignored until the women dropped the suit. Fans of the women's game are hoping that the tournament itself will become the focus in the coming weeks. But the lead-up to the Women's World Cup has always paled in comparison to the frenzy that surrounds the men, a sign of women's lack of status in international sport. Some, however, see the next month as an opportunity for FIFA to deflect attention onto the field. "In a strange way, the scandal can work to the benefit of the WWC," American soccer legend Alexi Lalas, an analyst for Fox Sports' coverage of the tournament, told me. "It is the perfect distraction and shield and it can come to represent the antithesis of the scandal. If I were FIFA, I would be steering and focusing everything and everyone towards the event. No one will forget the events of the last week, but if FIFA does it right, the WWC can at least provide a temporary escape." In a strange twist of events, then, maybe the scandal will finally allow the women to get their due. "FIFA is in the middle of a scandal of its own design, but if there is one thing that was made clear after the so-called turf debate, it's that the women's game is increasingly powerful, with or without FIFA," said Canadian soccer writer Keph Senett. "This popularity and fan loyalty is the fruits of women's labors -- the players -- not the organization. FIFA's comeuppance is just in time. It makes way for the fans to focus on top-notch sport played expertly by passionate professionals." This kind of star power is certainly true of the U.S. squad, which comes into the tournament as reigning Olympic champion. With Morgan and Wambach on the cover of Sports Illustrated, alongside teammates Carli Lloyd and Sydney Leroux, the hopes of the U.S. capturing its first crown since 1999 loom large and very possible. (Let's not talk about that heartrending shootout defeat to Japan four years ago.) The U.S. starts its march toward the July 5 final in Group D, squaring off Monday against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and then Sweden (June 12, Winnipeg) and Nigeria (June 16, Vancouver, British Columbia). If the team doesn't win its group -- and Australia's Lisa de Vanna and Nigeria's Asisat Oshoala are going to do their best to prevent it -- the road to an unprecedented third title will be more difficult, with powerful opponents such as Brazil and Japan waiting in the wings, and two-time champ Germany, ranked No. 1, looming ever larger, having crushed Ivory Coast in its opening match Sunday, a brutal 10-0. The Americans have their work cut out for them. While 15 members of the squad are World Cup vets, many of the stars, including Wambach and Morgan, have been fighting injuries of late. But there is hope that newbies such as Leroux, a power forward who has averaged the most goals in the fewest minutes of any U.S. women's national team member ever, will rise to the challenge. Last summer, Americans finally appeared to have caught World Cup fever: ESPN saw record-breaking numbers of viewers for U.S. games -- some 24.7 million watched the U.S. men's team square off against Portugal -- and fans found a legitimate rock star in goalie Tim Howard. While Fox Sports has seen heavy demand for advertising space, the women's tournament still poses the intriguing question: Will a chance for international glory be enough to get people to watch the women?

            <cabecalho>10 of the world's most amazing long-distance trails  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Craving dehydrated food and days without washing? These epic hikes are for you.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Long distance trails inspire contradictory tales of solitude and camaraderie, deserted river beds and mountain plateaus, pleasure and pain. The idea of covering thousands of miles on foot is itself barely believable. Perhaps that's what makes these adventures so memorable. Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her 1,000-mile trek along the U.S. Pacific Crest Trail was so enthralling it made it to Hollywood. "Wild," a film based on her account and starring Reese Witherspoon, was one of the most talked about releases at the end of 2014, with Witherspoon even nominated for a best actress award at the 2015 Golden Globes. If you'd like a piece of that action, or simply crave dehydrated food, days without washing and multiple, life-threatening encounters, then here are 10 other epic hikes ripe for big screen treatment. Who would play you? The Appalachian (United States) Distance: 3,510 kilometers (2,180 miles) The Appalachian is the grand dame of long-distance trails. One third of North America's holy hiking trinity, the Triple Crown -- the others being the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails -- it's the most iconic, famed for its "thru hikers" who attempt to complete it in a single season. Its 5 million steps follow the Appalachian Mountains from Mount Springer, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine. The range was once a natural border to the 13 colonies held by powerful Native American tribes like the Iroquois and Cherokee, before independence gave rise to westward expansion. Among the highlights: the idyllic, overgrown tracks through Great Smokey Mountains National Park in North Carolina, North America's most diverse forest. More information at: Appalachiantrail.org The South West Coast Path (UK) Distance: 1,016 kilometers (630 miles) The UK's longest National Trail is a stroll in the park compared to some of the other walks on our list, but what it lacks in longevity it makes up for in history. This dramatic coastal route from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole Harbour in Dorset, takes hikers around the tip of Cornwall, crisscrossing two World Heritage Sites including the famed Jurassic Coast. Nicknamed for its 240-million-year-old rocks, these prehistoric cliffs feature spectacular formations like Durdle Door and Ladram Bay. And while it may be shorter you'll still have to climb a total of 114,931 feet (35,031 meters or four times the height of Everest) to finish it. More information: Southwestcoastpath.com Te Araroa (New Zealand) Distance: 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) With a backdrop straight out of Middle Earth -- glacial ridges, windswept headlands, shires -- New Zealand's landscape doesn't disappoint. Te Araroa (Maori for "The long pathway") covers most of it; all the way from Cape Regina in the North to Bluff on the southern tip. "Tramping" the length of it, as the Kiwis would say, from the gentle bays of Queen Charlotte to the volcanic Mount Tongariro, takes about three months. Still, even at a fast pace you could be overtaken be overtaken. Ultramarathon runner Jezz Bragg completed it in a fantastical time of 53 days. More information: Teararoa.org.nz Continental Divide Trail (United States) Distance: 4,990 kilometers (3,100 miles) The third and longest installment of The Triple Crown is really a director's cut -- loved by serious trail enthusiasts but not for everyone. Spanning 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada along the Rocky Mountain spine of North America, it takes hikers across some arduous but spectacular terrain including the Red Desert dunes of Wyoming and the heights of Grays Peak (14,270 feet/4,350 meters) in Colorado. The standout feature is Triple Divide Peak in Montana, where the rain runs three ways to the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Arctic via Hudson Bay. Only 150 people attempt to thru-hike the trail each year. The youngest to complete it was 13-year-old Reed Gjonnes. More information: Continentaldividetrail.org Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker Historical Trail (Sudan-Uganda) Distance: 805 kilometers (500 miles) Trail blazers have recaptured the spirit of discovery with this historic route, which retraces the expedition of Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker's -- the first Europeans to set eyes on Lake Albert and name it after Queen Victoria's late husband -- to that great African lake, 150 years ago. Starting near Juba, in South Sudan, the greater part runs through Uganda to Baker's View, over Lake Albert, and takes in natural wonders like Murchison Falls, which break the Nile with a 141-foot (43 meter) drop as it flows to Lake Victoria. More info: Thebakertrail.com Oregon Desert Trail (United States) Distance: 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) The Oregon High Desert is a thrilling, stark arena in which to test your mettle. The route is a moveable feast of shorter trails, historic wagon roads and swathes of wilderness to pioneer as you desire, or "bushwhack," as hiking enthusiasts call it. Not for the inexperienced, the isolation and scarcity of water over long sections pose a serious challenge, requiring significant backup resources. But it's not all desolation. There's a quiet beauty to the landscape, which blooms wherever there's moisture. The truly remote, red-rock Owyhee Canyonlands seem to crumble away as you wander through. More information: Onda.org Grand Italian Trail, Sentiero Italia (Italy) Distance: 6,166 kilometers (3,830 miles) There are "Great" trails and even "Greater" trails. The Sentiero is best described as "Grand." It's an indulgent, convalescent tour traversing the entire Alpine arc before shimmying down the Apennine chain to Sicily and finally drifting west across the Tyrrhenian to Sardinia and Santa Teresa Gallura -- site of the ancient city of Tibula. The route was forged in 1995 by the first Walk Italy event and gives not so much a taste but a full five courses of La Dolce Vita: from the majestic Dolomites, via rich Tuscan vineyards, to the jaw-dropping splendor of the Amalfi Coast. With such varied terrain and the sheer distances involved a thru-hike takes considerable planning and roughly eight months to complete. More information: Traildino.com Great Himalayan Trail (Nepal) Distance: 1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) In a word: ambitious. Still being put together, when finished, this 4,500 kilometer (2,796 mile) skyscraping traverse will be the longest and highest mountain trail in the world, crossing the entire Himalaya range from Kashmir to Tibet, via India, Nepal and Bhutan. Nepal's section is the most complete and it alone offers one of the great trekking challenges. It's split into Low and High routes that run near parallel, beginning either side of Kanchenjunga Base Camp and ending on the Tibetan border in Humla. For high culture, the low route (still averaging 2,000 meters in height) passes through remote Nepali villages dotted along the hills and valleys. Only those with mountaineering experience should attempt the high route -- it peaks at a breathless 6,146 meters (20,164 feet). More information: Thegreathimalayatrail.org Hokkaido Nature Trail (Japan) Distance: 4,585 kilometers (2,849 miles) Japan is something of a distance-walking paradise, home to five of the world's 10 longest trails. At 2,849 miles and growing, this is the longest and last of them all, exploring the glaciers, forests and steaming, volcanic mountains of Hokkaido. Japan's northernmost island is roughly the size of Austria, with short balmy summers and long, cold winters. A complete tour takes seven months and is best divided by either side of winter. More information: Walkjapan.com Trans Panama Trail (Panama) Distance: 800 kilometers (497 miles) Anyone who has hiked in the tropics will testify to the difficult conditions. Sweaty, dense jungles, swarms of mosquitoes and numerous other bloodsucking creatures await and that's before you even begin this 500-mile journey. But the rewards are greater for those challenges. This cross-Panama route takes hikers from the border in Colombia to Costa Rica, and promises encounters with remote indigenous tribes like the Kuna and Embera. Hikers have a chance to canoe backwaters banked with lush rainforest and explore paths carved by conquistadors 600 years ago. Half complete in 2009, the whole route has now been mapped by Rick Morales, who himself completed it in just more than three months. More information: Transpanama.org  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>John Szalay ends 51 years of Newport-Ensenada sailrace - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>John Szalay, 79, competed for 51 consecutive years in largest point-to-point international sail race, between Newport, California, and Ensenada, Mexico.</descricao>
            <corpo>Ensenada, Mexico (CNN)The ol' mariner is hanging up his sails, after a half century of racing. The amateur has competed for 51 consecutive years in what's touted as the world's largest point-to-point international race, between Newport, California, and Ensenada, Mexico. Now John Szalay, 79, a Hungarian immigrant to the U.S. and a retired engineer and executive, is calling it quits, having competed in his last Newport-to-Ensenada race in April. "It's absolutely beautiful being on the water, it is so self-satisfying," Szalay said after having completed what he says is his last race. "You are living in God's country as far as I'm concerned, in southern California. For me, that was my relaxation." Only once in 51 years of competing did Szalay not finish the 125-nautical-mile race. That's when his engine faltered before the race, and a storm brewed with 48-knot winds and 15-foot seas. It was a reluctant but wise decision. "It was the only time we quit," he said, adding that his engine indeed died a half mile from his home harbor, in Newport Beach, California. "His track record is a rare achievement, even for an amateur in a sail race that has attracted such pros as Dennis Conner and Steve Fossett," said Dave Shockley, commodore of the race organizer Newport Ocean Sailing Association. Celebrities such as the late Humphrey Bogart and Buddy Ebsen have also raced the regatta. Amateur racing for 50-plus years is a mantle few share. Theirs is a tale of passion and romance for the seas. These sailors earn a name that evokes an ancient order of sportsmanship: Corinthian. "We do have a few 50-year people, but they are few and far between, and you'd have to try real hard to find someone as competitive and Corinthian a sailor as John," Shockley said. The Newport-to-Ensenada contest is also notable for how it features a panorama of the mountainous southern California and Baja coast and their offshore islands, ending in what's become the heart of Mexico's wine country. The Ensenada area produces 90% of Mexico's wines. If there's a timeless standard for a true sailor, perhaps it lies in the non-professional skipper who finds a way onto the water even while raising a family and holding a full-time job. Szalay immigrated to the U.S. at age 21 when he left his native Hungary during its 1956 Revolution. He arrived with his then girlfriend, Edith, now his wife since 1959. Szalay had no money and didn't speak English, but through ambition and hard work, he became a mechanical and electrical engineer. By the age of 35, he became president of engineering firm with 2,500 employees. "I was driven all my life," said Szalay, who's been retired for 11 years after a career largely in management, including at aerospace firms. "In a way, I'm a very, very lucky person. I'm an immigrant who came here with nothing and ended up doing very well," he added. He still speaks with a slight accent. It was in his native Hungary where he first went boating at about age 14. A friend took him to his parents' cottage beside the largest lake in central Europe, Hungary's Lake Balaton. They sailed. And that's where it began. "I absolutely fell in love with it," Szalay said. When he later bought a sailboat in his newly adopted country of the U.S., he asked his first son, then aged four, what to name their sailboat. The son, John Jr., chose a whimsical name that has been used ever since for the family boat: Pussycat. "Are you sure?" the father asked the son. "I want it named pussycat," the son replied, according to the father. "Fine," the father said. "So the boat name stayed," Szalay added. The boy became obsessed with the word apparently because a neighbor owned a cat he liked. When the older son became a graphic designer and artist, he even painted a grinning Cheshire cat on the stern. Since then, the name has been assigned to every boat the family owned and raced over five decades: a 26-foot-long Excalibur, a 30-foot-long San Juan, and their current 34-foot-long Peterson, all sloops. The amateur sail racing community has had its fun with the name. But when Szalay earned a reputation as a racer who often finished at the top of his class, sailors playfully used the boat name in another way -- "Meeeeow!" became the sailors' cheer. In all, Szalay finished first in class a total of 10 times in the Newport to Ensenada race, and he's finished either 2nd, 3rd or 4th in class in almost every one of the 50 races he completed, Szalay said. Szalay remembers his early sail racing years, in the 1960s, when sailors didn't have GPS or cockpit display screens for navigation. Navigation was done by dead reckoning with a radio direction finder and a chart. "I don't know how close we were to positioning, but we were able to navigate," Szalay said. "I mean, people navigated before GPS. Columbus navigated." His best race wasn't one where he felt he showed his best helmsmanship or tactical skills. It was about five years when, for the first time ever, both of his children joined him in the Newport-to-Ensenada race. "For the first time in my life, both sons came with us, and we won the race (in class)," Szalay said. "Of all the races I've done, that was the top." While Szalay doesn't directly mention it, what makes the brothers' participation more remarkable is how the younger son, Rene, now 47, uses a wheelchair because he has cerebral palsy. As such, Rene is assigned jobs in the cockpit during races. In fact, he was part of the crew in this year's race. With several other crew members beside him, Rene Szalay thanked his mates for accommodating his disability in the cockpit in this year's race. "We all love each other. I mean, I am a pain in the ass to get on the boat. I really am," he told them, pointing to the wheelchair in which he sat. His father, however, disagreed. His son posed no problem, he added. But Rene Szalay was also especially fond of the same race cited by his father. "That was the best day of my life," Rene Szalay recounted, with his father also beside him. "I will never forget sitting on the transom with you and my brother and having a beer. "For me to be there and to have experienced it, I could have died that day," the younger son told his father. Carol Kokol, a crew member who's raced aboard Szalay's boat for more than the past 25 years, said the team consists of very good friends who like to work hard. "So John's attributes are these: Number one, he expects to win," said Kokol, who's full-time job is a real estate agent in Costa Mesa, California. "He leaves the dock expecting to win. He works on the boat almost daily." Then she adds something else about the restless captain. "And every time we hit the finish line, he thinks we're in dead-ass last place—because we don't see any boats around us" that are in the same class, Kokol said. Added crew member Rob Daugherty: "It's a passion for me, too. He fills my passion for racing, too." Daugherty, a 63-year-old engineer from Irvine, California, has raced with Szalay for almost 28 years. Joining them has been Daugherty's nephew, Blake Thornley, 42, though for a few years short of that mark. So it's been a family experience by blood as well as in spirit. In this year's race, his final, Szalay and crew finished second in their class. John Szalay blames it on being dead in the water twice during the race with winds of "zero speed." "That was to me frustrating. But that's sailboat racing," Szalay said. It's frustrating enough that he's having second thoughts on his retirement from racing, he jokes. Such is the soul of a mariner. CNN's Michael Martinez sailed in advance of the Newport to Ensenada Race aboard skipper J. Scott Huston's cutter sloop, the Permanent Waves. </corpo>

            <descricao>Former FIFA official Jack Warner scores an own-goal by citing an article by satirical news outlet The Onion in an attempt to defend himself against criminal charges.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)An embattled former FIFA official has scored a spectacular public relations own-goal by citing an article by satirical news outlet The Onion in an attempt to counter criminal charges against him. Jack Warner, FIFA's former vice-president and a member of parliament in Trinidad and Tobago, was among those arrested last week in a U.S.-led investigation into corruption in world football. He was released on bail Thursday and is facing an extradition request from the U.S. government. In a video statement posted Sunday to his own warnertv.net website and social media accounts, Warner brandished a copy of a bogus news report by the satirical news website as he launched a broadside against the ongoing U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged bribe-taking and racketeering at football's governing body. The faux news report, titled "FIFA Frantically Announces 2015 Summer World Cup in the United States," jokingly suggested the sporting body had created an alternative tournament to appease U.S. officials. Warner accused the U.S. of "double standards" for agreeing to host the fictional tournament in cooperation with an organization it had accused of corruption. "If FIFA is so bad, why is it the U.S.A. wants to keep the FIFA World Cup?" he asks, pointing to a print-out of the report. READ MORE: FIFA in crisis -- who are the men who have been charged? He went on to elaborate his theory: "Why is it the U.S. authorities sought to embarrass FIFA in Zurich? Something has to be wrong. I made the point to you over and over that all this... has stemmed from the failed U.S. bid to host the World Cup." After Warner's blunder was ridiculed online, the video was removed from his social media accounts, only to be later replaced with an edited version, shorn of the reference to the Onion article. But a version of the original was reposted by a YouTube user. READ MORE: Blatter wins another term as FIFA president  Warner, head of Trinidad and Tobago's Independent Liberal Party, declared his innocence in the wake of last week's indictments and said in a statement that he had not been interviewed and "the actions of FIFA no longer concern me." In May 2011, Warner and fellow FIFA member Mohammed bin Hammam of Qatar were suspended by FIFA's Ethics Committee, pending the outcome of an investigation of corruption allegations against them. Warner resigned from his position the following month, and FIFA announced that "all Ethics Committee procedures against him have been closed and the presumption of innocence is maintained." On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed information on people who had pleaded guilty to various charges relating to FIFA in recent years. They included Warner's sons Daryll, a former FIFA development officer who pleaded guilty in 2013 to two counts related to wire fraud and structuring of financial transactions, and Daryan, who has forfeited $1.1 million as part of his plea and will forfeit an undisclosed sum when he is sentenced for wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and the structuring of financial transactions.

            <cabecalho>15 best restaurants to eat at in 2015 - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Some of our favorite restaurants are heading East while others are perfecting their traditional cuisines at home.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's going to be a great year for global foodies. Some of the world's biggest restaurants are exporting their brands to other countries -- some permanently, others only temporarily -- while top chefs are opening exciting new ventures. Here are some restaurant openings and events we can't wait to experience, as well as a few classics worth revisiting. Santina (New York) The Mario Carbone, Jeff Zalaznick and Rich Torrisi partnership expands with the recent launch of Santina near the Highline in Manhattan. Despite the Meatpacking District location, the focus here is on seafood, along with the group's Italian cuisine, which has proved successful in their Carbone restaurants in both New York and Hong Kong. Santina is named after Mario's grandmother, so Sicily will be featured strongly on the menu. Santina, 820 Washington St., New York; +1 212 254 3000 The Fat Duck (Melbourne, Australia) Heston Blumenthal's groundbreaking Fat Duck is temporarily decamping from wintry Berkshire in the UK to sunnier climes in Melbourne, Australia. The relocation to The Crown Towers Hotel offers diners the same three-Michelin-star experience and menu as the original, promising "a multi-sensory phantasmagoria." You're out of luck though if you'd like a table -- all reservations for the six-month stint have already been filled via an online ballot system that's now closed. Time to work that network of yours for an invite. The Fat Duck will be in Melbourne from February 3 to August 15, 2015. The Fat Duck, Level 3 Crown Towers, 8 Whiteman St., Southbank, Melbourne, Australia; +61 3 9292 5778 Noma at The Mandarin Oriental Tokyo Great chefs apparently think alike -- Rene Redzepi's Copenhagen-based NOMA is also taking a break from Europe and heading East, in this case for a stint at Tokyo's Mandarin Oriental hotel from January 9 until February 14, 2015. Beef tartare with ants, reindeer moss with cep mushrooms and sea urchin and duck are among the 20 servings offered across both the lunch and dinner menus. Once again however the six-week visit has sold out. Noma, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Muromachi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo; +81 3 3270 8800 Tivano, Temple House (Chengdu, China) With 14 million people, China's fourth most populous city is renowned as a gastronome's paradise for its often fiery but always nuanced Sichuan cuisine, available everywhere from street stalls to high-end restaurants. One missing piece in Chengdu has been high-end Western dining. That will change with the May opening of Italian restaurant Tivano in the city's new Temple House hotel that'll specialize in northern Italian cuisine and wines. Tivano, 81 Bitieshi St., Jinjiang District, Chengdu, China; +86 28 6636 9999 Flames, Four Seasons Hotel The Westcliff (Johannesburg) Joburg's venerable Westcliff Hotel, with views over jacaranda tree covered-hills and the elephants of the city's zoo, is reborn as The Four Seasons following a $50 million renovation. With it comes, Flames promises an authentic South African braai (barbecue) experience under chef Dirk Gieselmann. Specialties including boerewors and sosaties alongside kebabs and stellar steaks are accompanied by local beers and wines. Flames, Four Seasons Hotel, The Westcliff, 67 Jan Smuts Ave., Johannesburg; +27 11 481 6000  Chiltern Firehouse (London) Within days of opening, Chiltern Firehouse quickly became London's most talked about restaurant, bar and celebrity draw, a fixture of gossip columns. Dating from 1890, the building originally housed fire engines and now plays host to Portuguese chef Nuno Mendes' innovative cuisine with influences and ingredients from around the world. One downside of its popularity is that reservations can be hard to come by. Chiltern Firehouse, 1 Chiltern St., Marleybone, London; +44 20 7073 7676 Black Sheep (Manila, Philippines) One effect of the growing global appreciation of cuisine from the Philippines has been a restaurant renaissance in the capital Manila. Chef Jordy Navarra, a protege of the Fat Duck, is emblematic of the new wave. He's taken the Heston Blumenthal model of clever deconstruction of dishes and melded it with local Filipino produce, all in a dramatic penthouse setting overlooking the city. Black Sheep, Penthouse at W. 5th Ave., Taguig, Manila, Philippines; +63 2 478 4498 Restaurant David Toutain (Paris) Toutain's eponymous restaurant in the 7th arrondissement quickly won critical and customer acclaim for his inventive and unusual creations. Cauliflower mousse with coconut ice cream or fish with rhubarb and peas show that he isn't shy about pushing boundaries. The setting however is relaxed and un-stuffy and a world away from traditional French haute cuisine. Restaurant David Toutain, 29, Rue Surcouf, Paris; +33 1 45 50 1110 Corner House (Singapore) Jason Tan delivers what he calls "gastro-botanica," an approach that gives equal weight on the plate to protein and plants. The description is further understood given the restaurant's location in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. He reinterprets local dishes such as Kaya Toast. Ohers plates show his classical French training at Robuchon au Dome in Macau. Corner House, 1 Cluny Road, E J H Corner House, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore; +65 6469 1000 Lasai (Rio de Janeiro) In a city more famous for its relaxed beach bars and street food, young chef Rafael Costa e Silva has opened Lasai in the city's Botafogo district. He trained at the legendary Mugaritz in San Sebastian so knows modernist cuisine and fine plating inside out, as reflected in the two tasting menus that feature produce from the restaurant's own gardens as well as the country's famously good meats. Lasai, Rua Conde de Iraja, 191,Rio de Janeiro; +55 21 3449 1834  Zazu (Quito, Ecuador) Zazu's bright, sleek main dining room has a buzzy, laid back international feel, with a clientele to match. Any Ecuadorean will proudly insist that ceviche is their country's national dish, not Peru's. One option at Zazu features local stone crab served with olive oil, chili and, of course, lime juice. The suckling pig tacos might be an even better choice. Zazu, Mariano Aguilerra 331 y La Pradera, Quito, Ecuador; +593 2 254 3559 Statholdergaarden (Oslo, Norway) Bent Stiansen is a titan of Norway's food scene and a former holder of the hugely prestigious Bocuse d'Or.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <descricao>Jozef Wesolowski, the pope's ex-ambassador to Dominican Republic will be tried on child sex abuse charges at the Vatican next month, Vatican says.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The Pope's former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Jozef Wesolowski -- accused of offenses related to child abuse -- will be tried at the Vatican beginning next month, the Vatican said Monday. Wesolowski, 66, is the highest-ranking former Vatican official to be arrested for allegations related to the sexual abuse of minors and the first to be tried on such charges at the Vatican. Wesolowski is accused of possession of child pornography as well as offenses related to the sexual abuse of minors during his time as papal nuncio to the Dominican Republic. Before arriving in the Dominican Republic in 2008, Wesolowski was nuncio to Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. He began his career as a priest in Krakow, Poland, in 1972 and became a bishop in 2000. In August 2013, the Vatican said it was investigating Wesolowski and removing him from his post, but it did not give a reason. Monsignor Agripino Nunez Collado, a Catholic University rector, said an internal church report linked Wesolowski to child abuse and pedophilia. "We have formally opened an investigation," Dominican Attorney General Francisco Dominguez Brito told reporters at the time. "Here we have to work with two legal aspects, first national laws and also international laws in his status as a diplomat, which implies other mechanisms of investigation and judgment." In January 2014, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi confirmed to the National Catholic Reporter that the Vatican's criminal court was investigating Wesolowski. Pope Francis had announced in July 2013 that he was extending the court's jurisdiction in sex abuse cases to include papal diplomats, making Wesolowski's case the first test of the ruling, the newspaper reported. The Holy See defrocked Wesolowski in June of 2014. Wesolowski is not only charged with offenses during his five years as nuncio of Dominican Republic, but also with child pornography charges committed in Rome between August 2013, when he was recalled, and September 2014, when he was arrested, a Vatican statement said. He also faces charges in the Dominican Republic and in his native Poland, Vatican Radio reported in August. Per the pornography allegations, Italy's Corriere della Sera reported in September that Wesolowski's laptop contained more than 100,000 files with pornographic images and videos, some showing naked teens, between the ages of 13 and 17, forced to have sexual relations with each other or with adults. Some had been downloaded from the Internet and others appeared to have been taken by the victims, the paper reported. Three minors and their mothers are among the prosecution's witnesses, according to Corriere della Sera. When Wesolowski was presented with a detention order in September, the paper reported, he issued a statement: "I can clear my position and explain the mistake." Though the Vatican provided few details on the sex abuse charges, Dominican investigative journalist Nuria Esperanza Piera Gainza reported in 2013 that her sources alleged Wesolowski was a regular in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, where he would drink alcohol and pay children to perform sexual acts in the Monument to Friar Antonio de Montesinos, on the outskirts of the zone. "This will be a delicate and detailed procedure, requiring the most careful observations and insights from all parties involved in the trial," the Vatican said. Wesolowski's trial will involve information technology experts and international legal experts to evaluate evidence gathered in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The first hearing is scheduled for July 11. It's been reported that rather than being held in an Italian prison or Vatican detention cell, Wesolowski is under house arrest at a Vatican apartment for medical reasons. The church's sexual abuse guidelines allow local dioceses to make the initial decisions on the removal of accused priests. Papal nuncios, however, are appointed and supervised by the Vatican. Before he was elected pope, Francis said he supported a "zero tolerance" approach to clergy sexual abuse. In 2012, when Francis was still Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, he said that when he was asked for advice by another bishop, "I told him to take away the priests' licenses, not to allow them to exercise the priesthood any more, and to begin a canonical trial in that diocese's court." Shortly after his election to the papacy, Francis told a senior Vatican official to "act decisively" against sexual abuse and carry out "due proceedings against the guilty." In July 2013, the pope made it a crime to abuse children sexually or physically on Vatican grounds. The acts were already crimes under church law, but are now specifically outlawed within the Vatican city-state, which is home to hundreds of people.

            <cabecalho>Paraguay: We're protecting life of pregnant 10-year-old - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Paraguay's government says it's doing it everything it can to protect the life of a pregnant 10-year-old and the fetus she's carrying.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Paraguay's foreign ministry says it doesn't need to follow steps recommended by an international human rights committee that weighed in recently on how the country is handling the case of a 10-year-old pregnant girl who was allegedly raped by her stepfather. In a statement released Sunday, the foreign ministry said it rejects a list of demands from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights about what it should do to protect the life of the girl. Paraguay already "has taken all the appropriate measures to avoid impunity for the wrongful act committed and to ensure the life and safety of this girl and the fetus," the statement said. Last week, the human rights commission, which is part of the Organization of American States, cited recent testimony from U.N. experts saying Paraguay's government had "failed in its responsibility to protect a 10-year old sexual abuse survivor and provide her with critical and timely treatments, including a 'safe and therapeutic' abortion." At issue is Paraguayan law, which bans abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. The Paraguayan Ministry of Health has said there's no indication that the health of the girl is at risk. But the human rights commission said that the girl, now 26 weeks pregnant, is facing a serious health situation with a significant possibility of complications. It criticized the Paraguayan government for not releasing enough information about the case and questioned whether the girl and her family were being provided enough information about the situation and the significant medical risks. The mother of the minor has been imprisoned, charged with breaching her care of duty. Last month, police arrested the girl's 42-year old stepfather, accusing him of raping of the child. He denied this accusations. The case has drawn international attention and sparked debate on the largely taboo issue of incest in South America. According to data from UNICEF, in Paraguay, every day two girls from the ages of 10 and 14 give birth to a baby that is the result of sexual abuse. Paraguay's Ministry of Health says that in 2014, over 680 minors from the ages of 10 to 14 reported a pregnancy. Paraguay has a population of 6.7 million. CNN's Rafael Romo and Jason Hanna and journalist Sanie López Garelli contributed to this report. </corpo>
