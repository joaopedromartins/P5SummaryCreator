            <corpo>(CNN)Three people have died and dozens more are injured after a man drove into a crowd -- on purpose, the local government says -- Saturday in the Austrian city of Graz. The 26-year-old male driver intentionally used his vehicle as a weapon, the Graz City Council said in a statement. Roman Sommershsacher, a spokesman for the Austrian city's government, said the man drove through Graz's inner city -- including into a place where cars are not normally allowed -- trying to hit people. One of the three fatalities is a child. At least 34 more people suffered injuries, Sommershsacher said, including ten seriously and one in critical condition. The driver -- described as an Austrian citizen with Serbian roots -- has been arrested, officials said at a Saturday afternoon press conference. The officials added that they don't know the man's motive but do not believe it has anything to do with terrorism. Photos from the scene showed a mangled bike and what appeared to be a body draped by a white sheet. Located in Styria province in southeastern Austria, Graz is that country's second-most populous city.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Warning: Click on this website that demystifies those three-letter airport codes and your workday be ruined.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Ever wondered why the designation for Vancouver International Airport is YVR? What the story is behind the ignominious SUX abbreviation for Sioux City, Iowa? Where those unique three-letter airport codes came from, anyway? No? Don't worry. A couple of airport trivia nuts have done all the thinking for you and set up a super-cool website explaining the origins of what are known as IATA (International Air Transport Association) Location Identifier Codes around the world. Launched on March 11 as the brainchild of a pair of friends in Arizona, Airport Codes has us diverting more time from work this week than our Facebook feeds or sneaking out for two-hour lunches. After working our way through most of the entries on the site, we reached out to creators Lynn Fisher, a designer and developer, and Nick Crohn, a software engineer, to get the story behind the stories behind airport codes. CNN: What's the inspiration for the site? Lynn Fisher: A few years ago I heard someone talk about the rationale behind airport codes and ever since I've found it interesting. After a Google search I realized there wasn't really a place that explained them all. So we decided to make a site that did just that. CNN: What's the goal of the site? Fisher: It's definitely just a fun project. We don't have any plans to commercialize it. We're happy with sharing the neat information we find. CNN: What's the response been so far? Nick Crohn: Since launching on March 11th, we've had about 245,000 visitors. Lots of people (and airports) have contributed via GitHub and tweeted codes at us. We are excited so many people have found it interesting and are working hard to keep up with the submissions. CNN: Which airport codes draw the most attention? Fisher: The Canadian airports are very popular because many of them don't seem to make any sense. CNN: Which have the most intriguing back stories? Fisher: One of my favorites is definitely SUX (Sioux City, Iowa). It's not a great code and after petitioning to change it twice, they decided to embrace it. Their slogan is "Fly SUX." Crohn: I'm going to go with ORD [Chicago's O'Hare International Airport]. I like how it's so different from O'Hare and hints at the airport's history. That's probably one of the things that's most enjoyable about the codes. They are keys to the airport's history. CNN: How did the whole three-letter code thing begin anyway? Fisher: Weather stations had unique two-letter identifiers and as airports grew and increased in number, they switched to three-letter codes. A podcast called "Layovers" recently talked more in-depth about this. Here's the link. At the bottom is the podcast and the time that part of the conversation happens. CNN: Are there any codes for which there isn't a reasonable explanation? Crohn: We're still pretty stumped about a lot of Canadian airport codes. We've reached out to a few and even they aren't sure where their codes came from. Some of them seem like a completely random pick. CNN: Can people contribute stories behind airports not listed on your site? Fisher: Yes! We have a long list of airports to add, and we're excited for every suggestion!  </corpo>

            <descricao>A parachutist with the British Army's Red Devils stunt team rescued a teammate in mid-air after his parachute failed during a jump at a UK airshow.</descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)A parachutist with the British Army's Red Devils stunt team rescued a fellow jumper in a midair drama after his parachute failed during a stunt jump. The dramatic scene played out above the heads of anxious spectators at the Whitehaven Airshow in Cumbria, northern England. A statement on the Facebook page for the airshow said one of the parachutists' chutes failed to deploy properly. Brian Sherwen, an official photographer for the event who witnessed the incident, said he saw the two men "dropping through the sky." He was able to see exactly how the rescue unfolded through a videographer's powerful zoom lens. "It was obvious the top jumper was wrapping his legs around the ropes of the parachutist below -- his legs were carrying the weight of the man below and his tangled parachute," he said. "There was quite a lot of flailing of the legs, then the bottom guy stopped struggling and just held his legs straight down. "The top guy was obviously in control and was trying to find a safe area to land. They were falling down at least twice as fast as the other people who were jumping with them." The two men didn't land where they were supposed to for the display but in a nearby marina busy with big yachts with masts, Sherwen said. "They've done very well to get down in the open water," he said. He spoke to a member of the team afterward and said he seemed quite blas√© about the death-defying maneuver. "They acted like it was just another day at the office," he said. "We can confirm that the Red Devil parachutists are both safe &amp; sound," the airshow's Facebook statement said. "For the first time in 25 years they had a parachute fail. One team member caught his team-mate &amp; brought him into Queens Dock. Our safety procedures worked perfectly &amp; a huge thank you to Whitehaven Marina for getting them out of the water so quickly." A subsequent statement confirmed that the team members were "both fine" following their splash landing. Another witness, Tom Davies, told CNN: "We are all just relieved no one was hurt, but the team member saved his buddy without doubt. He is a hero."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A woman in Major League Baseball? It's now officially possible. And the female who could have the opportunity to play at the top level of the sport known as America's pastime isn't even an American. Melissa Mayeux, a 16-year-old shortstop who plays for the French under-18 junior national team, has been added to the MLB international registration list, according to MLB.com. She's the first known female baseball player to register for the league's international signing period, according to MLB's communications department. It's unlikely that Mayeux will be signed, but it's still a historic moment. An MLB team could sign her starting July 2. Mayeux, who speaks little English, said she grew up with a group of boys playing baseball. "I've never had a problem with integration because we've known each other for such a long time," Mayeux said. "We're very well connected. That makes a good team. Never any problems." Mayeux is one of four players from the French team selected to participate in MLB's European Elite Camp in August. According to MLB.com, 76 players have signed with MLB teams in the 10-year history of the camp. Two reached the majors. Mayeux would like to continue playing baseball in France until she is 18, she told MLB.com, and then either start university or find another opportunity abroad. She wants to keep playing baseball as long as possible. "I think there are plenty of girls behind me that want to take the same path as me, and I hope they have the same path as me, and I hope they make it," Mayeux said.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Why Waterloo still fascinates us (Opinion) - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>For the British, the battle of Waterloo both gave them their empire but also created the conditions that eventually ensured that the sun would set on it.</descricao>
            <corpo>Andrew Roberts is the author of "Napoleon: A Life." The views expressed are his own. (CNN)The bicentennial of the Battle of Waterloo on Thursday is being commemorated across Britain this month, with hundreds of receptions, speeches, bonfires, museum exhibitions, TV and radio programs, university lecture series, church services, auctions, book publications and all the other paraphernalia of massive public celebration. What has struck me most powerfully, though, is how many people are hosting private dinners at their own houses for friends, at which they will be toasting the Duke of Wellington's victories. Across the country, people are digging out their family memorabilia and showing it off to neighbors with pride. Only this week, I gave a speech in Oxford about the Duchess of Richmond's famous pre-Waterloo ball. There, a lady who is descended from Wellington's mistress Lady Frances Wedderburn-Webster brought along the shawl that she wore to the ball that fateful night. Wellington was right to say that the battle was "the nearest run thing you ever saw in your life." And although he only won it because of Britain's Belgian, Dutch and especially Prussian allies, there was a huge price to pay. Waterloo lit the slow fuse of the horrifying force of German hypernationalism, the defeat of which required the sacrifice of the British Empire 130 years later. Although at the time the battle seemed merely like the last of a series of traditional dynastic and territorial struggles, in fact Waterloo ushered in the modern world. And as Winston Churchill predicted at the end of the 19th century: "The wars of peoples will be more terrible than the wars of kings." The Vienna Treaty that followed Waterloo gave Britain Cape Colony, Trinidad, Ceylon and various African and Asian possessions, the nodal points for what was swiftly to become a huge oceanic empire. With the Union Jack flying over the castle at Cape Town, the Royal Navy would always be able to keep the trade routes to British India open. After Waterloo, France was returned to much her same borders as before the Revolution and was later in the century only permitted to occupy minor and tangential colonies, often with more sand than raw materials. With low birthrates, lackluster industrialization vis a vis Britain, small navies, generally unproductive colonies, endemic political crises (often prompted by people with Napoleonic fantasies) and regular military defeats -- most spectacularly in 1870-71, 1940 and 1954 -- France was set on a downward trajectory ever since Napoleon's Imperial Guard broke at Waterloo. Even her victory in World War I was only won after the hecatomb of Ypres; in all, 1.4 million Frenchmen died in the conflict, against 880,000 Britons. Britain has stayed on generally very good terms with France since 1815, having that year secured everything she needed for her future greatness. The Entente Cordiale works, as the Libyan and Mali expeditions and the joint use of France's aircraft carrier shows. Instead, France's true nemesis turned out to be Britain's co-victor at Waterloo: Prussia. However, although we often look at Waterloo from the British perspective, and occasionally from the French, we almost never view it through the prism of Prussia. Indeed, without the Prussians, Wellington would not have fought the battle -- and probably could not have won it if he had. The Prussian contribution to the destruction of Napoleon soon entered the mythology of the Prussian state and, along with the contributions of Prussian Field Marshal August Graf Niedhardt von Gneisenau and Prussian General Gerhard von Scharnhorst in the War of Liberation of 1813, it became an integral part of the foundation myth of Otto von Bismarck's mighty new German empire after 1870. The Kaiser was to recall the Prussian victory at Waterloo before World War I, and the two Iron Crosses won by Adolf Hitler in that war, for example, were both stamped with the talismanic date "1813." First Prussian nationalism, then its successor German nationalism, and ultimately their bastard child hypernationalism, were to leave scars on the 20th century far worse than anything left by Napoleon in the 19th century. Indeed, if the allies had merely left Napoleon alone in 1815 and contained him instead of destroying him, his already much-weakened France could not have posed any threat to the peace of the continent before his death from stomach cancer at 51 less than six years later. For the British, the battle of Waterloo both gave them their empire, but also, in the long run, created the geostrategic conditions that eventually ensured that the sun would set on it. For the Prussians, the battle fomented dreams of continental domination that it took two world wars to eviscerate. For the French, it extinguished those same dreams, never to be rekindled. There is therefore much for Britons to commemorate about that extraordinary battle just south of Brussels 200 years ago. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>Roger Federer tuned up for his tilt at a record eighth Wimbledon title by claiming the Halle crown for the eighth time Sunday.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Roger Federer tuned up for his tilt at a record eighth Wimbledon title by claiming the Halle crown for the eighth time Sunday. The 33-year-old grass court maestro beat Italian Andreas Seppi 7-6 6-4 in the final and will now head to SW19 full of confidence. "I hope this is a good omen for Wimbledon," Federer, who was beaten in the 2014 All England final by Novak Djokovic, told gathered reporters. It was Federer's fourth title of the season after wins in Brisbane, Dubai and Istanbul, and the 86th of his remarkable career.  But an 18th grand slam crown -- with many believing Wimbledon offers his best chance -- is surely top of Federer's wish list and he believes the Gerry Weber Open in Germany offers the best warm-up. "I was the first to win Halle and go on to win Wimbledon, which I think for the tournament was really important for them to show all the other players around the world that Halle is the perfect preparation for Wimbledon," he told the official Wimbledon website. "I like that we have a roof here. There's always going to be something going on for TV, media and fans to see. I think it's an ideal preparation." Federer had to work hard to beat Seppi, who was fresh after his quarterfinal and semifinal opponents Gael Monfils and Kei Nishikori were hit by injuries. The first set went to a tiebreak, which Federer won for the loss of a single point, while a single break in the second took him over the line after one hour 48 minutes.  Meanwhile, Andy Murray, who will be one of Federer's main rivals at Wimbledon, won the competing ATP 500 event at Queen's Club in London. It was Murray's fourth title at the grass court tournament, joining John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt on that mark. The home hope had to play twice Sunday, completing a 6-4 7-6 win over Viktor Troicki of Serbia in a semifinal held over from the previous night due to poor weather. Murray then beat Kevin Anderson of South Africa 6-3 6-4 in the title match, showing the sort of form which had marked his historic Wimbledon triumph in 2013, itself preceded by victory at Queen's Club. Murray, who has been in superb form since marrying Kim Sears in April, was claiming his third title of the season and 34th overall, moving him level with Arthur Ashe, Michael Chang and John Newcombe on the all-time list. In WTA final action Sunday, Germany's Angelique Kerber beat Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic for the title at Birmingham, winning 6-7 6-3 7-6.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>World's largest man-made ice cave opens in Iceland - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>If exploring deep into an ancient ice pack isn't cool enough, there's the ride on an old cruise missile launcher. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Several years ago, a team of Icelandic entrepreneurs dreamed of tourists not just exploring the surface of Iceland's glaciers, but actually getting inside of one. Four years and $2.5 million later, Iceland's first man-made ice cave has opened to visitors. Located in the western part of Langjokull (Long Glacier), and 1,260 meters above sea level, the ice cave stretches deep underground giving visitors the chance to see ice that's been forming over centuries. Stepping inside the cave is daunting at first. Visitors strap crampons onto their shoes to navigate the slippery and slushy floor. Eyes need to adjust from the shocking bright white surface of the glacier to the dim LED-lit interior. Jagged cuts in the ice turn smooth and the colors of the ice change as visitors get deeper, changing from a cloudy white to shocking deep blues. Information about the island's receding glaciers line several sections of the cave, along with benches to sit and enjoy the tunnel. Visitors are treated to views of gaping crevices as they run their fingers along the walls of the tunnel.  A special area in the cave, which developers named the "chapel," with blocks of LED-lit blocks of ice supporting wooden beams, will serve as venue for parties, weddings and concerts, says Sigurdur Skarphedinsson, managing director of Into the Glacier. "Some might call it the ultimate wedding venue." The ice cave, which consists of tunnels and caves that stretch 500 meters into solid glacial ice, is an awe-inspiring feat, and one that must be maintained. "There are many challenges when it comes to building and taking care of an ice cave high up on an ice cap," says Skarphedinsson. "The weather is probably the biggest factor. We are dealing with extreme weather up there. "A typical day during the winter involves clearing the entrance every day. There isn't any sign of an entrance after a snow storm." It's easy to forget that there's ice in Iceland during the summer. Each June, the tiny North Atlantic island with a population of 325,000 people transforms from a snowy white and rusty brown landscape to lush greens and vibrant yellows as grass, moss and plants awaken after a long and dark winter. In fact, 11% of the country is covered in ice from several glaciers. Langjokull, the second largest glacier on the island, was chosen due to its proximity to Reykjavik. It's 130 kilometers to Husafell, the town where the tour begins, from Reykjavik. "It's really accessible and there are not too many crevices in the area we chose," says Skarphedinsson. Indeed, crevices are a concern as fresh fallen snow can lightly cover huge gaps in the ice, which could damage vehicles. Because of the danger, the trip to the cave is an experience in itself.  Guests board a 20-ton customized monster truck designed to traverse the soft, sloping snow and rocky ice of the glacier. One of the guides, Arngrimur Hermannsson, explains that a unique vehicle is needed to roam the challenging landscape. "We have a tire pressure system where tires can deflate while we drive," says Hermannsson. "We need to do that to be able to go over soft snow." He's proud of his truck, named the Ice Explorer, which seats ups to 45 passengers. The truck was acquired from NATO, where it was originally used as a cruise missile launcher. "I had to sign a contract saying that I would be the last owner of the vehicle," says Hermannsson. "NATO doesn't want it in just anyone's hands." On clear days, the climb on the barren, icy desert to the ice cave is magnificent. During the five-kilometer climb from the base camp, Hermannsson explains the impact of climate change on Iceland's glaciers along with the geology of the region. The project managers ensure that the environmental impact of the ice cave is minimal. "We've only removed 5,500 cubic meters of ice from a 900-square-kilometer glacier," says Skarphedinsson. "It's a bit like taking a drop of water from a bathtub." It's estimated that the ice cave could last 10-15 years without maintenance. "We assume that in 10 years, some parts of the ice cave will need to be rebuilt," adds Skarphedinsson. "There's more pressure on the ice in the lower part of the ice cave and the glacier itself is moving slowly." Tours are operated year round and prices start at ISK 17,900 ($135) for a three-hour tour and go up to ISK 268,500 ($2,020) for private tours.

            <descricao>As the hours tick down to the latest deadline for Athens to repay outstanding debts, what could the impact mean for the rest of the EU and world.</descricao>
            <corpo>Anand Menon is Director of the UK in a Changing Europe initiative based at King's College London. Follow him on Twitter @anandmenon1 The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author's. (CNN)So Greece finds itself in the last chance saloon -- again. As the hours tick down to the latest deadline for Athens to repay outstanding debts to its creditors, the issues of Greek default, Greek exit from the euro and, even, Greek exit from the EU itself once more command the attention of politicians and pundits. The first thing that should be said is that Greek default does not imply Greek exit from the EU or even from the euro. There are simply no legal provisions governing the expulsion of a state from the single currency, and thus no clear mechanism by which this could be achieved even if Athens fails to satisfy its creditors. How Greece could drop out of euro Economically, there are those who argue that a reversion to the drachma would be a rational strategy for the Greeks themselves to adopt in the event of a default. Readopting a national currency would allow the government to keep paying its employees while offering the potential for exporters to benefit from a preferential exchange rate. Doomsayers, on the other hand, point to the catastrophic impact that default had on the Argentinian economy and mutter darkly about the possible risks to European banks exposed to Greek debt. Complete meltdown Above and beyond the economics of the Greek crisis, however, what is clear is that the political implications of a default and possible euro exit would be huge and largely negative. Within Greece, a complete economic meltdown would lead to a bitter political battle as the new elections that would certainly result spawned bitter fights between the left and the right. Whilst specialists on Greek politics seem to dismiss the possibility of another army coup in that country a la 1967, an election held at a time of severe economic dislocation and uncertainly about the country's future would certainly benefit extremist parties. At best, one could imagine the steady of drain of the country's most talented individuals to continue. At worst, a descent into extremist-dominated ungovernability. Nor would the political ramifications be confined to Greece itself. Governments in the other countries on the receiving end of EU-mandated austerity having been closely following events there. Debt relief offered to Athens might inflame their own opponents of austerity. Should Greece exit the euro and perform relatively well, such pressures would increase. A Greek meltdown, if it was not effectively contained, could conceivably harm them too, if markets decided, once the euro exit was clearly an option, to target other weak economies. Grexit and Brexit A third area where Grexit would have implications is the ongoing talks between David Cameron's British Government and other EU leaders about the former's desire to "renegotiate" its relationship with the Union. Pros and cons of a 'Brexit' Some in the UK feel that a Greek default and euro exit would strengthen Cameron's hand, making his partners desperate to avoid any further disruption to their cherished integration "project." Yet this seems somewhat fanciful. Grexit would herald a long and potentially ugly process of adjustment within the eurozone as officials rush to ensure legal provisions catch up with economic events on the ground. Thereafter, the priority of eurozone members would be to insulate the single currency against future harmful fractures. More than ever, Cameron's demands for a special deal with come to seem like a distraction from the real priorities of the union. And this without taking into account the wider context. One of the reasons why German Chancellor Merkel has been less hawkish in her pronouncements on Greece than her Finance Secretary, Wolfgang Schauble, is that she is only too aware of the wider geopolitical implications of a Grexit. As the EU's southern neighborhood implodes, chronic instability in a member state so close to North Africa hardly bodes well in terms of the stability of the region. Nor would a Greek government struggling to finance itself be best placed to help in the increasingly intense struggle southern member states are fighting to control the flow of migrants from North Africa. Foreign policy Perhaps more unsettlingly, economic turmoil in Greece would have potentially damaging effects on that state's foreign policy priorities. Greece at make or break moment Whilst EU and even euro membership command the support of a majority of the Greek people, some kind of forced exit from the eurozone, with the consequent economic problems and feelings of humiliation this would engender, could alter those sentiments rapidly. It is no surprise, then, that even the U.S. administration is now admitting its concern lest Athens turn towards Moscow for support in the event of a Grexit. The recent visit by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to St Petersburgh underlined the close links between the two states. And whilst Russia is in no position to bail out the Greek economy, an increasingly anti-western Greece run by a party stuffed with pro-Russian Marxists would hardly be reassuring for EU states anxious to maintain a united front on Russian sanctions. Above and beyond the economic implications of a Grexit and consequent economic crisis, then, such a scenario raises the possibility of a number of potentially harmful political outcomes both within Greece and further afield. This, as much as the desire to keep an economy that amounts to about 2% of the eurozone, helps explain the desperation amongst Europe's leaders to avoid such an outcome.  </corpo>

            <descricao>EU foreign ministers have extended sanctions against Russia imposed due to the country's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, an EU spokeswoman said.</descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)European Union foreign ministers meeting Monday in Luxembourg extended sanctions against Russia imposed because of the country's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, an EU spokeswoman has told CNN. The sanctions were imposed a year ago to punish Russia for its annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and its military support for separatists in the eastern regions of Ukraine, which border Russia. The sanctions consist of asset freezes on some Russian companies and people as well as travel bans against certain officials. A Kremlin spokesman condemned the extension of the sanctions. "Russia, naturally, considers these sanctions to be unfounded and illegal, and we have never been the instigators of sanction measures," the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists. Peskov said Russia would respond by extending measures against the European Union, which include restrictions on the import to Russia of foodstuffs from the EU. The Kremlin spokesman said the restrictive measures undermine the interest of EU taxpayers.  The sanctions, and the events that preceded their imposition, reflect the tug of war between East and West over the future of Ukraine -- and the divisions within the country as well, between ethnic Russians and Ukrainian speakers who want closer ties with the European Union. The turmoil began in earnest when President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian speaker, decided not to sign an agreement for closer ties with the EU, as he had planned. Instead, he opted for closer ties with Russia. His about-face led to mass protests, and he was driven from office in February 2014. But his ouster provoked resentment and secessionist sentiment in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, leading to Crimea's annexation by Russia and bloodshed in the east -- where secessionists were supported, according to Western officials, by the Russian military. The conflict has not yet been resolved. The pull between East and West, and between ethnic Russians and longer-term natives, is evident in many former Soviet republics, in an arc stretching from Moldova in the south to Latvia in the north.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Tbilisi, Georgia (CNN)A tiger and a hyena were still on the loose in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi on Thursday, a day after a man was mauled to death. The director of the city zoo confirmed that he didn't know the whereabouts of the animals, or whether they are alive or dead. The animals broke free when the zoo was hit by flash floods last weekend, leaving hundreds of exotic creatures roaming the streets.  On Wednesday a 43-year-old man was killed by a white tiger, which was later shot by police. A day before the man was killed, the Georgian Prime Minister had said there were no more dangerous animals at large. He later apologized. Also on Thursday, Georgian authorities identified a woman whose body was found in the flood-hit area of Mziuri Park, in the center of Tbilisi. She was named as Liza Zarandia, 22. Her death brings the total to 20, with several people still missing.  The Georgian Ministry of Heath has begun offering tetanus vaccinations to volunteers who are involved in the search and cleanup effort. Hundreds of young people have given their time to work in the area since the disaster happened. City residents were urged to stay indoors for their own safety in the immediate aftermath of the floods. The zoo lost about half of its 600 animals, including lions, tigers, bears and wolves, in the natural disaster. Journalist Eka Kadagishvili reported from Tbilisi, and Eve Parish and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>CNN meets the air traffic controllers who get 73 million people a year safely through UK's Heathrow Airport
</descricao>
            <corpo>London, England (CNN)As they stare out of the four-story plate glass windows of Heathrow's control tower, Jason Cooper and his team should be gnawing their fingernails and swabbing the sweat from their brows. On any given day, they're in control of one of the most insanely busy stretches of airport runway on the planet, guiding tens of thousands of people on and off the ground. One false move could spell disaster: at best the costly loss of a precious runway slot; at worst a genuine aviation tragedy and massive disruption across European airspace. Which is why it's both surprising and reassuring to find, during a recent CNN visit, that the atmosphere inside the tower at Heathrow, the UK's largest airport, is one of almost Zen-like calm. "There's pressure, but no stress," says Cooper, who manages Red Watch, one of three groups of air traffic controllers (ATCs) that staff Heathrow's tower day and night. "I think most of us enjoy the pressure." Under his command today are an apparently genial mixture of men and women of varying ages, all dressed down. They do their jobs quietly and efficiently, talking into radio headsets, occasionally chatting to one another. Outside though, the activity is relentless.  With five terminals and only two runways -- each handling 19 million more passengers annually than any other airport in the world -- Heathrow is perpetually congested. Airliners, including giant Airbus A380s, line up on taxiways for takeoff, while the sky is filled with an endless parade of jets coming in from or heading out to destinations around the globe. It's the job of the tower controllers to keep snarl-ups to a minimum -- a high wire balancing act that requires intense focus and an impressive array of gadgetry. Standing 87 meters over Heathrow, the tower offers impressive views stretching miles over flat terrain. Even on the cloudy day of CNN's visit it's possible to pick out the tower blocks of London's financial district, nearly 30 kilometers to the east, and Windsor Castle to the west. That incredible view -- what Cooper calls "the greatest office window" in the region -- is an essential part of the job. The controllers need visual confirmation of every takeoff and landing, only resorting to radar, radio and computers when the weather closes in. Inside the tower there are two tiers -- a raised central dais where two north and south runway controllers sit back-to-back, and a lower ring occupied by the ground controllers who govern aircraft from start-up at the stand until they've taxied into position on the runway and vice versa. (Air traffic control company NATS has a cool 360-degree panorama of the tower on its website: http://bit.ly/1Hzo7N7) By law the controllers can only work in 90-minute stretches punctuated by half-hour breaks over a six to nine-hour shift. These relatively short work stints help them focus on the task of moving as many planes as quickly as possible -- up to 42 takeoffs per hour on a good day.  Fingers dance over the touch screens as the controllers move around computerized strips (these used to be paper strips) that represent the planes and talk to pilots via the radio. There's tricky mental juggling to perform as they figure out how to maximize takeoff slots so larger planes aren't followed by smaller aircraft that must wait longer for turbulence to clear. At night there are extra complications guiding aircraft along Heathrow's busy taxiways. This is done using a giant touch screen that ATCs swipe to illuminate different stretches of Tarmac -- possibly one of the world's largest lighting control decks. There are also tracking monitors that show the position and movement of all aircraft on the ground, and screens detailing meteorological elements such as wind direction and speed. Cooper shows off a relatively new piece of kit called the TBS -- or time-based separation -- that's proving crucial to Heathrow's traffic flow. Instead of spacing aircraft on approach by distance, it factors in wind speed and works out how many minutes apart they can land safely. All good when everything runs smoothly, but what happens when it doesn't? Much of the control tower's calm atmosphere seems to be down to the contingency measures in place for when problems arise. It's typically overstaffed in case sudden sickness depletes numbers. And, says Cooper, almost every system is backed up at least two or three times.  In the event of a power cut, the tower has an emergency generator. If that fails there are batteries. And if those go, staff can quickly relocate to a standby tower facility in a secret location nearby. The controllers really earn their money (in the UK more than $150,000 per year including overtime for senior ATCs) when disaster strikes and their cool nerves are tested to the limit. Touch screen telephones in the control tower feature an oversized "crash" button, which instantly puts the ATCs in immediate contact with the emergency services and ground crews they need to coordinate with during major incidents. Cooper recalls a 2013 incident involving a fire on board an empty, parked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing Dreamliner that closed the airport and led to a scramble to clear nearby airspace. "It was a very intense day at the office," he says. "Most days here are hard work, some are harder than others. You don't get a job as a Heathrow controller and expect to put your feet up for a couple of hours." Few people, it seems, are cut out for air traffic controlling. The qualifications required are minimal, but ATCs need an innate range of skills that allow them to perform the mental acrobatics needed to keep everything flowing. (Try these games on the NATS website: http://bit.ly/1GyKaTa) Only one in every 300 applicants makes the cut but they come from all walks of life. Cooper says Heathrow employs ATCs in their 20s barely out of school alongside staff with multiple doctorates to their name. The training is necessarily lengthy, taking up to two years. Even when qualified, ATCs can spend 18 months working under guidance before being allowed to operate solo. The same goes for experienced controllers moving to a new airport. And it never stops.  Cooper takes us to a non-descript office block a few miles away from Heathrow where an almost full-sized control tower simulator has been constructed to help train and prepare ATCs and allow them to road test new aircraft and airport structural changes. It's like a gigantic, awesome $2 million Xbox console with a 360-degree screen. "We use it to put our ATCs in nasty situations," says Cooper, his fingers instinctively tapping the screen to line computer-generated aircraft up on the runway. "But it has to be relevant, you can't just come in here and set everything on fire just for the hell of it." Sim manager Daniel Johnson puts his virtual tower through its paces, showing us weather conditions from thick fog to driving snow. He then takes us on a weird, stomach-flipping, out-of-body experience, sending the tower whizzing through the airport and out over London. We also get to try our hand at clearing a few virtual jets for take off. Even though it's not real, talking to the pretend pilot (actually Johnson in the next room) and moving the aircraft strips on the computer to get a pixilated Virgin Atlantic 787 off the ground proves a nerve-fraying experience. Cooper isn't too impressed with the yawning gaps we allow between take offs, but offers some consolation. "Even for us every day is a school day, you learn something about how to do the job differently. "The place changes every day and you have to stay on top of the changes, but I cannot imagine having a job where you didn't."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A stowaway on a British Airways jet was found dead after falling on a roof as the plane approached London Heathrow Airport, authorities said Friday. It's unclear whether the man had crouched in the wheel well, a common hiding place for stowaways. A second man who was hiding in the undercarriage of the plane was hospitalized with injuries, the airline said. The plane was flying from Johannesburg to London when the man fell and landed above a business in Richmond, southwest London. Johannesburg and London are about 6,000 miles apart, and the flight is nearly 12 hours long. Airline tracking website FlightAware.com lists British Airways Flight 54 as a Boeing 747. It departed Johannesburg on Thursday night and arrived at Heathrow at 7:26 a.m. London time Friday. In a statement, the UK Metropolitan Police said an investigation is underway, and British Airways said it's working with authorities in both nations to get more details. Plenty of people have hitched a ride on a plane by holing up in a wheel well. Most don't survive. In April last year, a 15-year-old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a Boeing 767 and flew from San Jose, California, to Maui, Hawaii. He survived. In February of the same year, crews at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington found the body of a man inside the wheel well of a South African Airways plane. It's not difficult to climb inside a wheel well, said Jose Guillen, a ground operations coordinator at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. "You can grab onto the struts and landing gear assembly kind of like a ladder," he said. "And you just jump on the tire and climb into the wheel well." But after takeoff, many scenarios could kill a stowaway hiding in the landing gear wheel well. Inside, there's not much room -- even less than in the trunk of a car, Guillen said. A stowaway would need to guess where the tire is going to fold in when it closes after takeoff, he said. Otherwise, there's a high risk of getting crushed once the gear starts going in. This issue of stowaways making it aboard flights has raised questions about airport security. CNN's Richard Greene and Thom Patterson contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>In the world of golf, there's no doubt that Jordan Spieth is quickly turning into the main man, after adding the U.S. Open title to his Masters success.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)Who's the daddy? In the world of golf, there's no doubt that Jordan Spieth is quickly turning into the main man. The 21-year-old became the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 on Sunday, and only the sixth man in history to double up by winning the Masters in the same year. The Texan was quick to pay tribute to his father Shawn, who watched on from the gallery as his son made it a Father's Day to remember. "I was certainly playing this round for my Dad," Spieth told CNN after clinching his second major title following April's record-breaking Augusta success. "He's the one that got me started in the game. He was the one who gave me any opportunity to do what I wanted, to do what I loved. "It didn't have to be golf -- it could have been anything." Spieth won on a dramatic final day at Chambers Bay after compatriot Dustin Johnson three-putted from 12 feet on the 18th to finish one shot adrift. He finished on five-under for the tournament and is now the fourth-youngest player to win two majors. Sport runs in Spieth's family -- his father played baseball at college and his mother was a basketballer, as is his brother Steven. "Dad never pushed me but asked me to set goals and I told him I want to do this," he said. "So he said, 'You're just going to have to set your goals and work hard to achieve them.' "I owe everything that I am and of course my whole career to my parents." After his Masters win, Spieth spoke of his admiration for his 14-year-old sister Ellie, who has autism. The world No. 2 is now planning a shopping spree to mark this latest triumph, which earned him $1.8 million and closed the gap on top-ranked Rory McIlroy, who tied for ninth on Sunday. "I'll take her to the store and let her pick it out," Spieth said. "We will probably go shopping when I get home. It will be really cool getting home to Ellie." Spieth will now rest up ahead of next month's British Open at St. Andrews, where he will be aiming for a third consecutive major success. While all the talk will be about a potential "Spieth slam," golf's rising star is taking it all in his stride. "Our team is just setting the goal to get into contention for the next major," he added. "I am focused on the claret jug now. That's what the sole focus was the second the U.S. Open ended. "Whether that's good or bad, it's going to be a really cool scene carrying the first two majors -- but then it's a while new animal to tackle."

            <cabecalho>Pope: 'Revolution' needed to fight climate change - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Pope Francis has encouraged people to "welcome with an open heart" his encyclical on the environment, which is set to publish at 6 a.m. ET Thursday. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)As a former teacher, Pope Francis knows how to deliver a stern lecture. On Thursday, he gave one for the ages. While slamming a slew of modern trends -- the heedless worship of technology, our addiction to fossil fuels and compulsive consumerism -- the Pope said humanity's "reckless" behavior has pushed the planet to a perilous "breaking point." "Doomsday predictions," the Pope warned, "can no longer be met with irony or disdain." Citing the scientific consensus that global warming is disturbingly real, Francis left little doubt about who to blame. Big businesses, energy companies, short-sighted politicians, scurrilous scientists, laissez faire economists, indifferent individuals, callous Christians and myopic media professionals. Scarcely any area of society escaped his withering criticism. "The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth," Francis said. "In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish." Francis' bracing manifesto came Thursday in the form of an encyclical, a letter traditionally addressed from St. Peter's Square to the more than 1 billion Catholics across the globe. Derived from the Greek word for "circle," an encyclical is among the church's most authoritative teaching documents. Special coverage: How 2 degrees are key to climate change But Francis has set his sights far beyond the circle of his church. With an eye toward several key climate change summits scheduled for later this year, the Pope said his letter is addressed to "every person living on this planet." "I would like to enter a dialogue with all people about our common home," Francis said.  The humble invitation belies the damning analysis of modern life contained in the 184-page encyclical, entitled "Laudato Si." The archaic Italian phrase, which means "Praised Be To You," appears in the "Canticle of the Sun," a song penned by St. Francis, the patron saint of ecology. Read the full encyclical (PDF) Subtitled, "On Care for Our Common Home," the encyclical was published Thursday in at least five languages during a news conference at the Vatican. The document was more than a year in the making, church officials say, and draws on the work of dozens of scientists, theologians, scholars from various fields and previous popes. "We have a situation here," said Janos Pasztor, the U.N.'s assistant secretary-general for climate change, "in which science and religion are totally aligned." Pasztor was part of a team that convened with church officials at the Vatican this April. The Pope's highly anticipated encyclical recycles some of the now-familiar themes of his papacy: an abiding concern for the poor, a scorching critique of the idolatry of money and a facility for using evocative language to describe complex conundrums. As the first Pope from the developing world, Francis brings a moral vision shaped not in the seminaries of Europe but in the slums of Buenos Aires, Argentina. With language ranging from the majestic (lyrical poetry in praise of nature) to the mundane (take the bus!), the Pope put his signature stamp on a controversial topic and his moral clout on the line. "Laudato si" is long on laments and short on specific solutions, though the Pope repeatedly urges deep thinking and dialogue to address the complex symptoms now plaguing the planet. In broad strokes, Francis calls for a drastic change in "lifestyle, production and consumption" from unsustainable habits to more mindful means of caring for "our common home." "What kind of world do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up?" Francis asks. "The question not only concerns the environment in isolation; the issue cannot be approached piecemeal." And while the Pope calls for practical steps like recycling and improving public transportation, he said structural injustices require more political will and sacrifices than most societies seem willing to bear. Nothing short of a "bold cultural revolution" could save humanity from spiraling into self-destruction, the Pope warned. Though it ends with a prayer, many parts of Francis' encyclical seem profoundly pessimistic, particularly from a spiritual leader known for his hopeful messages of mercy and openness. People no longer seem to believe that happy days lie ahead, the Pope lamented Our care for the environment is intimately connected to our care for each other, he argues, and we are failing miserably at both. "We are not faced with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social," Francis writes, "but rather one complex crisis which is both social and environmental." The rich and powerful shut themselves up within self-enclosed enclaves, Francis argues, compulsively consuming the latest goods to feed the emptiness within their hearts, while ignoring the plight of the poor. The Pope's 10 commandments on climate change The poor, meanwhile, find themselves on the run from natural disasters and degraded habitats, shunted to the bottom of the world's pile of problems with decreasing access to its natural resources. Francis saves his most challenging questions for modern consumers, arguing that humanity has become enamored of another apple -- and this time no Eve or serpent are around to take the fall. The temptation may have shifted from a forbidden fruit to cutting edge technology, but the sin remains the same: hubris. "We are not God," the Pope warns, "The Earth was here before us and has been given to us." Powerful quotes from the Pope's encyclical  Though Popes since Paul VI in 1971 have addressed environmental degradation, "Laudato Si" is the first encyclical to focus primarily on creation care, the Christian idea that God gave humans the earth to cultivate, not conquer. Even months before its publication, the encyclical drew criticism from conservatives and climate change skeptics, who urged the Pope not to put his moral weight behind the controversial issue of global warming. Many Catholics and environmentalists, meanwhile, eagerly awaited the encyclical. The Washington-based Catholic Climate Covenant, for example, plans to send homily hints to the 17,000 Catholic parishes in the United States for priests to use during sermons this summer. The group is also planning media events with bishops in Iowa, California, New Mexico and elsewhere. In the weeks before the encyclical's release, Protestant pastors and at least 300 rabbis in the United States also said they were willing and eager to embrace Pope's call for environmental justice. A Brazilian group made even made a tongue-in-cheek trailer ahead of Francis' encyclical, portraying the pontiff of a spiritual superhero gearing for battle against the forces of evil -- energy executives. In another sign of the anticipation awaiting the encyclical, the news that an Italian magazine had published a leaked draft of the document online on Monday made the front pages of several American newspapers. From the first days of his papacy, Francis has preached about the importance of the environment, not only as a scientific concern but also a moral one. In his first homily as pontiff, Francis called six times during the short sermon for humans to protect creation. The encyclical published on Thursday goes well beyond any sermons, delving into fields familiar to any Catholic, such as Scripture and theology, but also wandering into sociology, politics, urban planning, economics, globalization, biology and other areas of scientific research. Broken into six chapters, "Laudato Si" begins by cataloguing a host of ills wracking the planet: dirty air, polluted water, industrial fumes, toxic waste, rising sea levels and extreme weather. The problem is "aggravated," the Pope said, "by a model of development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels." If present trends continue, Francis argued, the changing climate will have grave implications for poor communities who lack the resources to adapt or protect themselves from natural disasters. Many will be forced to leave their homes, while the economically and politically powerful "mask" the problems or respond with indifference, the Pope said. The poor may get a passing mention at global economic conferences, Francis says, but their problems seem to be merely added to agendas as an afterthought. "Indeed, when all is said and done," the Pope said of the poor, "they frequently remain on the bottom of the pile." Opinion: Listen to the Pope about climate  Conservatives like Rush Limbaugh called Francis a Marxist after he released another statement, called an apostolic exhortation, in 2013. In the statement, the Pope called trickle-down economics "crude" and "naive." Limbaugh renewed the criticism on Wednesday, accusing Francis of adopting "communist way of doing things: Controlling mankind through ... governments backed by police or military power." Apparently undeterred, the Pope doubles down on his critique of modern capitalism -- especially aspects of the free market -- in "Laudato Si." "We need to reject a magical conception of the market, which would suggest that the problems can be solved simply by an increase in the profits of companies or individuals," he said. What's more, the Pope called the idea that the "invisible forces of the market" can adequately regulate the economy the "same kind of thinking" that leads to the "exploitation of children and abandonment of the elderly who no longer serve our interests." In one particularly searing section, Francis compared laissez faire economists to mobsters, drug lords, illegal organ harvesters and human traffickers. All are part of a "throwaway culture," the Pope argues, that treats human beings as just another commodity to exploit. The Pope's attack on the "myth of progress" is more surprising. But he connected his critique to a "worshipping of earthly powers," where humans have usurped the role of God, imposing our own laws and interests on reality with little thought to the long-term consequences. Opinion: Message from Pope: Hey you, stop ignoring climate change In particular, he argued that our "cult of human power" and blind adoption of technology has been a Faustian bargain, offering a wealth of benefits, but at the risk of losing our souls. "Life gradually becomes a surrender to situations conditioned by technology," he said, "itself viewed as the principle key to the meaning of existence." "It has become countercultural," Francis continued, "to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology." The omnipresent digital media feeds our "information overload" and "mental pollution," the Pope said. Those, in turn, lead to an excessive self-centeredness that tends to "shield us from direct contact with the pain, the fears and the joys of others and the complexity of their personal experience." "Nobody is suggesting a return to the Stone Age," he continued, "but we do need to slow down and look at reality in a different way." Despite his bleak view of our present situation, the Pope offered glimmers of hope near the end of his "joyful and troubling" reflection. "Yet all is not lost," Francis said. "Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start, despite their mental and social conditioning." Is the Pope right on technology?  Opposition to the Pope's encyclical began several months before it was released. In April, the Heartland Institute, a conservative group skeptical of climate change, mounted a campaign to convince Pope Francis that global warming "is not a crisis." "The Pope is putting his moral authority behind the radical environmental agenda of the United Nations -- and he's doing it after being told only part of the climate story," Jim Lakely, a Heartland spokesman, said in an email interview on Tuesday. Lakely said Heartland will contact "hundreds of thousands of Catholics" in the United States through mail and email countering the Pope's message and "giving them the truth about climate change." That may be a difficult task. More Americans trust Francis almost any other world or U.S. leader as a source of information on global warming, according to a survey conducted by Yale University and George Mason University. Still, the same poll showed that less than 10% of Americans view climate change as a moral issue. 5 key questions about the Pope and climate change According to a Pew Research Center study released on Tuesday, American Catholics are divided along partisan lines over climate change. More than 7 in 10 believe the planet is getting warmer, and nearly half attribute global warming to human causes. A similar number (48%) view it as a very serious problem, according to Pew. But while more than 80% of Catholic Democrats say there is solid evidence that the Earth is warming, just half of Catholic Republicans agree. And less than a quarter of Catholic Republicans believe that global warming is a man-made or poses a very serious problem. Christiana Peppard, a professor of ethics at Fordham University, said she is not surprised that more Catholics are unconvinced that climate change presents a moral imperative. "There's an idea that science exists in a realm separate from the way we live our lives," said Peppard, author of the book "Just Water: Theology, Ethics, and the Global Water Crisis." But the Catholic Church has long taught that scientific facts, while reliable, don't answer deeper questions about human meaning and morality. "For that, ethical reasoning and contemplation are important," Peppard said. On the 2016 campaign trail, though, the Pope's eco-encylical seemed to be a tough sell. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who is Catholic, said the Pope should "leave science to the scientists." At a town hall in New Hampshire this week, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Catholic convert, said, "I don't get economic policies from my bishops or my cardinals or my Pope. I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm." Pope hands GOP climate change dilemma Other Catholics, though, were eagerly awaiting the Pope's encyclical. In addition to Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, the Vatican panel presenting "Laudato Si" included Metropolitan John of Pergamon, an Eastern Orthodox priest; John Schellenuber, founding Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research; Carolyn Wo, the Chinese-American director of Catholic Relief Services; and Valeria Martano, an Italian historian and member of the Rome-based lay Catholic Community of Sant'Egidio. Woo said her assignment is to connect the encyclical's concerns to the business world. Over the past 20 years, said Woo, former dean of the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, some corporations have adopted more ethical approaches, and she expects a wave of letters from business leaders this week praising the Pope's initiative. "The bottom line is that we need business, not just some, but all, to do more," Woo said. "They are the ones on the front lines. We need them on board." The Pope will also need world leaders to buy into his moral message, which will be key before a U.N.-sponsored climate summit in December, said Pasztor of the U.N. At the meeting, nations are expected to submit their plans for reducing greenhouse gases, and the Pope will likely repeat the encyclical's entreaties when he speaks at the U.N. General Assembly this September. "Having such an important person as the Pope talking about this issue will reach a lot of people," Pazstor said, "and at a crucial time."

            <descricao>CNN retraces the journey of children from Egypt to Italy finding evidence that many are smuggled by criminal gangs who then use them for illegal activities.</descricao>
            <corpo>Sicily, Italy (CNN)The 13-year-old boy looks off into the distance. He is slight of build with pale, almost yellowy eyes. When you see him you feel as if he has seen far too much already. He is carrying a burden far too heavy for his age -- but despite his ordeal so far, smuggled across continents from Africa to Europe, and now living in a care home, his future could be far worse depending which route he takes next. A CNN investigation spent months retracing the smuggling route from Egypt to Italy. Speaking to social workers and authorities, children and parents, there is evidence that many of the children were smuggled into Italy by the same criminal networks, who once they are in country, use them for illegal activities. The Egyptian government agency charged with advising lawmakers on child protection matters told CNN that they believe in some cases the parents are guilty of trafficking, paying for their own vulnerable children to be smuggled so far from home in the hope of securing the family's future. We were interviewing this Egyptian boy and his friends in the picturesque piazza of a small Sicilian town. They came over to Italy together on an Egyptian smuggler ship. He was 12 at the time and crammed in with hundreds of others. He says his parents paid 35,000 Egyptian pounds (about $4,500) for the privilege, never guessing what it would really be like -- tossed around for nine days, surrounded by vomit, and scared, uncertain what would meet them on shore. I asked him what he would say to all the boys back at home, hoping to follow in his footsteps. He said he would warn them not to come but he also said he knew they wouldn't listen. "Why would they? I didn't," he says. "Everyone does what their mind tells them. They won't take what we say." I asked if, having suffered so much, he'd make the journey again? "What can I do? Yes. The burden back home is still the same." Italian authorities say he is one of more than 1,000 young Egyptians sheltered in 100 Italian care homes now dotting the Sicilian countryside. The cobbled streets and 17th Century architecture is a very long way from the Nile Delta villages many of the boys have come from. I asked one of his friends if he calls his parents and what he tells them about their lives here, and if he's told them how close to death he came. "I tell them nothing, just pleasantries and ask for their prayers. What difference would it make? They need me to make money." These boys tell us their parents went in to debt to raise the fare for their crossing. They saw it as an investment in what they hope will be a better future for the whole family. The children are expected to find work as soon as they can and start sending money home. Here at the care home, that's not possible so thousands of children are disappearing from the Italian social care networks. Italy's Ministry of Labor told us almost 4,000 Egyptian children disappeared from the care system. All the Italian authorities we spoke to who work with these children told us the pressure on the children would be unbearable even for an adult. They fear the consequences to their parents if the smugglers didn't get their money in full, or if the gamble doesn't pay off having sold what little of value they have. The missing children can't work legally. Social workers tell us that too often the children turn to drugs, even prostitution, to get by. Another boy we meet at the home asks me wistfully about Rome, which Italian authorities say is where so many of the disappeared head to. I told him Rome is dangerous for children on their own, especially on the streets. I told him the stories we'd heard from the Egyptian teenagers we'd met in Rome -- the exploitation and the homesickness. The Egyptian children in Rome tell stories of friends selling themselves on street corners -- but they sound suspiciously like they were speaking about themselves. I told him it's better to do it all the legal way and better for him to get an education. He listened politely until I'd finished then told me: "Better to be dead than useless."

            <descricao>Claire Howeson used to craft hats as a way to relax after her demanding job as a human rights lawyer. Two years ago she turned her passion into a job.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Claire Howeson used to spend every Monday night crafting hats for friends and family as a way to relax from her job as a human rights lawyer. A year and a half ago, she decided to pursue her passion full-time by launching a luxury hat company: Penmayne of London. Howeson's designs, which are made from start-to-finish in Britain, are stocked in London's luxury department store Harrods, and have also been featured on the pages of Vogue magazine. "There is something incredibly beautiful about a woman in a hat and, as a brand, we want to empower women to wear hats in the same way that they carry a handbag," she says. The milliner spent years preparing her career switch, but admits that making that final step was difficult. Here, she shares her tips on how to start a fashion business with CNN.  Howeson stresses that being flexible and able to respond to your client base is crucial when building a business from the ground up. "If you're being told by all of your customers that they want pink hats, you need to be making pink hats," she says. "You've got to be adaptable and when things go wrong, learn very quickly."  With millinery for special occasions, such as weddings, in abundant offer in Britain, Howeston thought that there was a gap in the market for beautifully made hats which could be worn every day. "There just aren't very many people doing it and we think we're doing it really well," she says. "My passion for hats is very much about every day hats. We want these to be wardrobe staples that women wear every day," she says.  Howeson spent six months working for two hat makers in London in order to get the technical experience to get her company off the ground. She also completed a millinery course at Kensington and Chelsea College before launching Penmayne of London at the end of 2013. "Developing a product is very difficult and the attention to detail on absolutely everything has to be second to none, because otherwise you're going to end up with a product that's less than perfect," she says.  Having a strong, thought-out concept of what you want your product to be before you launch is extremely important according to Howeson. "You've really got to do your research and plan how you're going to take it to market, and what your strategy's going to be in the first years," she says.  The businesswoman says that resilience is one of the most important qualities for entrepreneurs, as is the ability to make light of difficult situations. "You've got to have a really good sense of humor when everything goes wrong, and just not be afraid of failing, really," she says. You've just got to be prepared for an adventure. It's so exciting, but it's such a roller coaster, lots of ups and downs," she adds. Read more: How to make millions from art Read more: How to launch your own NGO  </corpo>

            <descricao>You'll want to book a window seat if you're flying into any of these 10 airports.  </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For jaded air travelers, window seats are overrated. Not having to climb over snoring seat mates to get to the toilet often trumps the desire to gaze at fluffy white clouds and brown squares of farmland as the plane descends. There are, however, exceptions. PrivateFly, a global booking platform for private jet charters, has just released the results of its 2015 global survey of the world's most scenic airport approaches. When you're flying into these 10 beauties, which offer views of everything from mountainous landscapes to glittering skyscrapers, you're going to want to be in that window seat. New Zealand's Queenstown Airport came out the big winner, followed by Las Vegas McCarran Airport and Nice Cote D'Azur Airport in France. The PrivateFly Best Airport Approaches 2015 poll was conducted in March and April of this year and received more than 3,000 individual votes, says the company. A total of 147 global airports received nominations. "Our poll has become an annual checklist for the well-traveled, and offers a fascinating mix of global descents," says Adam Twidell, CEO of PrivateFly and an experienced pilot. "From iconic city views such as Las Vegas and London City; to tiny remote airstrips such as Saba in the Caribbean (the world's shortest commercial runway); and the unique beach landing at Barra in the Outer Hebrides." Here are the top 10 scenic airport approaches, according to PrivateFly's 2015 survey. 1. Queenstown Airport, New Zealand 2. Las Vegas McCarran Airport, United States 3. Nice Cote D'Azur Airport, France 4. Barra Airport, Scotland, UK 5. St. Maarten Airport (Princess Juliana International), Caribbean 6. Saba Airport (Juancho E Yrausquin), Caribbean Netherlands 7. Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Canada 8. Gibraltar Airport, UK 9. London City Airport, UK 10. Cape Town Airport, South Africa Previous winners of the annual poll include Nice Cote D'Azur (2014); St. Maarten in the Caribbean (2013) and Barra in Scotland's Outer Hebrides (2012).

            <descricao>Not long ago, Shenzhen's start-up community was fighting for attention. Now it has a thriving scene of small companies investing in hardware. </descricao>
            <corpo>Shenzhen, China (CNN)Soon after computer engineer Terry Ouyang finished university, he found there was plenty of work with industry behemoths such as IBM. But it wasn't long before he ditched the corporate ladder to make hardware on his own terms. "Our generation's motivation is different," Ouyang told CNN. "Our parents were focused on making a living. But we want to do interesting and original things. Instead of making things for other companies, we want to make things ourselves." Just a few short years ago, Shenzhen's start-up community was fighting for attention. Today, this sprawling city of over 10 million -- which lies just north of Hong Kong, across the border with mainland China -- is home to big names like Huawei, as well as a thriving scene of small companies. A select few of which have attracted major investors and global consumers, from robot kit maker Makeblock to drone maker DJI. Is this Chinese drone maker worth $10 billion? In recent years, Shenzhen's hardware entrepreneurs have faced skeptics who say real entrepreneurial energy can't flourish in a country such as China. They say while it is evolving economically, it still struggles to protect companies from intellectual property theft, and retains a closed political system. Yet, the government has publicly declared that it supports entrepreneurs, while "maker" communities and incubators are sprouting up across China. Ouyang, 31, is one of the administrators of SZDIY (Shenzhen Do-It-Yourself) a member's association that meets in an old industrial building and builds everything from vehicles to games. The workshop is a study of contrasts: at once dusty and hi-tech. "Our goal at SZDIY is to find like-minded engineers and others who are really passionate about making things," says Ouyang. But he tempers his enthusiasm with a dose of reality. Despite the attention they've received, the Shenzhen start-up community is still a minnow in China, given the country's size. "The people who have the mindset of a maker is a very small group," he says. "It's easy to start a company in Shenzhen. But we need time to fail and to learn from mistakes. Also, the engineers and the designers don't talk to each other enough."  Cyril Ebersweiler, the 36-year-old founder and managing director of Haxlr8r -- a Shenzhen-based hardware start-up accelerator -- says it makes sense that entrepreneurs are flocking in ever-greater numbers to the epicenter of the world's electronics manufacturing, despite any uncertainties about China's socio-political evolution. "Entrepreneurs need to be in the right ecosystems at the right time," says Ebersweiler. "For fundraising, you go to Silicon Valley. For hardware and manufacturing, you come to Shenzhen." It also helps that Shenzhen is home to Huaqiang Electronics World -- a massive components emporium where, day-in. day-out traders sell the circuit boards, LEDs, bolts and screws that go into the world's electronic gadgets. Originally from France, Ebersweiler has worked in Asia for over a decade. Haxlr8r acts as an early investor for a range of hardware start-ups from all over the world, which apply for a spot in Haxlr8r's program. They invite the companies to their loft in Shenzhen for 111 days of intense prototype development and refinement. Then it's off to the U.S. to meet potential investors and impress the media. "This is only the very beginning of the battle," he says. "What the companies do here is only an indication of what's next. The biggest challenge is fear. And today there is enormous pressure. Everyone expects Apple-level quality." As for fears of intellectual property theft, some say China's pirated goods purveyors -- collectively known as "shanzhai" -- are actually bringing benefits to the hardware start-up community. "It's interesting, the shanzhai are getting to a level of quality that's actually helping us," says Ebersweiler. "If you go to the market and take a look at shanzhai products, if you look at the finishing -- some of it is incredible. We learn from their cost-saving techniques."  Hong Kong also has a batch of recently launched accelerators, though the former British colony is lacking the major benefit of Shenzhen, which is the proximity to parts suppliers and some of the world's most experienced factories. Brinc, which also has offices in Shenzhen and Guangzhou, is a Hong Kong-headquartered accelerator focusing on IoT -- or, the 'Internet of Things' -- hardware. Brinc gives its companies an introduction to factories in China, and helps with crowdfunding campaigns and distribution launches. "Hong Kong has a fantastic banking system, (a) very strong litigation system, and it has an ecosystem of local service providers that help with branding and registering IP," says Manav Gupta, 30, CEO of Brinc. "If you decide to do some of this in Shenzhen, it's a little more challenging -- understanding who to talk to, understanding the psyche of doing business in China. We provide a service backbone to our companies so they can plug in when they go to China." Soundbrenner, a company founded in Germany and invested in by Brinc, makes what it calls the world's first wearable metronome for musicians, which they are anticipating will go on sale by the end of the year. "Coming from Berlin, the biggest problem building our product in China was finding reliable partners because we had never manufactured anything before," says Florian Simmendinger, the 26-year-old Soundbrenner CEO. "The second problem was the communication barrier -- which we solved with a very good Chinese project manager. And the third problem was the cultural differences, the way you solve problems and the quality of execution in each phase, which we successfully overcame to leverage as opportunities in doing business in China." For now, change is accelerating for Shenzhen's entrepreneurs, despite China's significant growth challenges. "In the past few years, the mindset has changed," says Ebersweiler. "Manufacturers are willing to give something new a shot. Until recently, factories weren't willing to take anything less than an order of 100,000 units. Some big factories are now willing to take a punt, especially since we've been around for a while."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A fourth "Fifty Shades" book, this time told from hero Christian Grey's perspective, is published Thursday -- on what devotees may know is the character's birthday. Author E.L James announced plans on June 1 to publish the book, "Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian." James will be signing her book Thursday morning at the Barnes and Noble bookstore on New York's Fifth Avenue. Fans in New Zealand were among the first to be able to get their hands on a copy. James said in a statement posted on her site that she had written the book after receiving requests from "thousands of readers" for Christian's point of view. "Christian is a complex character and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations, and his troubled past. Also, as anyone who has ever been in a relationship knows, there are two sides to every story," James said. Anne Messitte, Vintage Books publisher and James' editor, was quoted on the website as saying the new book has "all the compelling attributes of its predecessors" and that she was excited for its readers. The trilogy of "Fifty Shades of Grey," "Fifty Shades Darker" and "Fifty Shades Freed" caught Hollywood's attention, and the first book was made into one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015. The film starred Jamie Dornan as Christian and Dakota Johnson as his love interest, Anastasia Steele. It's made more than $166 million since its release on February 14. The sequel, "FIfty Shades Darker," is set to arrive in theaters in 2017.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Some kids grow up being scared of clowns, others dread the bogeyman under the bed. Now children in Scotland have a new monster to haunt their dreams -- or at least end up hidden away safely in the closet. A terrifying depiction of what is allegedly supposed to be a sun, "Kingsley" is the new mascot for Glasgow football club Partick Thistle. Designed by artist David Shrigley, the yellow creation -- which bears some resemblance to a mutated Lisa Simpson -- will feature at every home game for the 2015-16 Scottish Premiership season. It was unveiled as Partick -- nicknamed "The Jags" -- announced a new partnership with California-based investment firm Kingsford Capital management, owned by U.S. businessman Mike Wilkins. Wilkins, a shareholder in 2015 NBA champion Golden State Warriors, had been looking for a UK business opportunity. A commissioner of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, he met Wrigley -- who was nominated for the prestigious Turner Prize in 2013 -- at a dinner in San Francisco. "When I got talking to David Shrigley about Partick Thistle it seemed like it could be the perfect fit," he said in a statement on the club's website. "I hope that this relationship will become more than just your average sponsorship deal." Partick Thistle managing director Ian Maxwell described the two-year deal as "a real coup." "We need to look at how to attract new people to football in Scotland, both in terms of funding and in terms of supporters, and some of the ideas that Mike and David have already brought to the table are really interesting," Maxwell said. Glasgow-based Shrigley has also designed a Kingsford logo to appear on the team's shirts and at the stadium. "As a Jags man it's an honor to be involved with the club in this way. I can't wait to see my design on the front of the shirts and around Firhill," he said. He might be the only one. What do you think of the mascot? Tell us on CNN FC's Facebook page  </corpo>

            <corpo> (CNN)Tough, strong and noble; these are the sorts of qualities one would expect from a national symbol. The fabled Karabakh horse is a rare and beautiful animal that is of great importance to Azerbaijanis. But the country's national animal that can be found everywhere from its stories to its postage stamps is faced with extinction. In the thickly forested foothills of Sheki, a small city 300km (187 miles) from the capital Baku, is one of world's largest and purest Karabakh herds. Their owner, Yashar Guluzade, has been restoring the breed for over a decade in this unspoilt mountainous region. He says that conflict and a difficult economic situation have led to their decline. "At the beginning of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict the horses were continually transferred from one place to another and this was one of the reasons for the sharp reduction of stock as the movement of pregnant mares led to miscarriages," he explained. Guluzade says that the places the horses were taken did not have the correct conditions and pastures to support them and it was as if the country had forgotten about them. The government has now stepped in to try and protect the breed. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Agriculture has drawn up a number of horse breeding programs and the law states the animal cannot be exported for sale. The ministry says it may consider selling the horses in the future to raise money for their upkeep but for now the focus is on breeding and protection. Khandan Rajabli, the managing director of the ministry's breeding division told CNN that these programs include improving veterinary services, training and scientific studies on the horses' DNA. "Instituting a system of identification like passports to track the breed has been established" he said. Rajabli says that a German company is also assisting with gene research and establishing the horses genetic profiling so a system can be developed to confirm the breed in future. German horse breeder, Verena Scholian, is one of the experts that have been working with the Azerbaijani government, advising them on breeding programs and technical equipment. Scholian, who has spent decades researching the Karabakh's blood-line, says it's easy to see the horses appeal. "I love handling them; they are calm, friendly and very sure footed," she said. Estimates on the number of Karabakh horses vary. According to the Karabakh Foundation, there are less than 1,000, but Scholian believes there could be less than 10 mares that are one-half pure bred. The mountain-steppe racing horse is named after the geographical region where it was originally developed. The Karabakh horse is the result of cross-breeding and stands out with what's been described as its "golden glow." The horses are also known for their exceptional speed. The Karabakh foundation says that in 2004, a horse from the Agdam region set a world record; running 1,000 meters in 1 minute and 9 seconds. The foundation's chair, Dr. Adil Baguirov, originally from the Karabakh region, says the horse has always been important to Azerbaijani's. "Azerbaijanis are Turkic people who until a few centuries ago enjoyed a semi-nomadic lifestyle, especially in the Karabakh region, which is lush with grass and has perfect pastures," he said. "Even as late as the 19th century, a sizable portion of Azerbaijanis, particularly in the Karabakh region, lived in mountains in the summer and in lowlands in the winter," he continued. Baguirov explains that it was the horses ability to handle mountainous and rugged terrain that deemed them an essential part of life. These days Scholian says the horses are mainly used for racing and as a status symbol for the rich. Guluzade currently has 35 pure bred Karabakh horses on his farm. He says he will continue to breed them because he is worried about their future. "My strategy for breeding was built on the premise that each pure bred mare should leave behind one offspring, preferably a mare," he said. "I will continue my work in this direction where others have been irresponsible in the past," he continued. The century-old breed is said to have incredible endurance and strength, qualities that Azerbaijani's hope will see the animals fight off extinction. "The Karabakh horses are a symbol of national heritage and pride. It's an ancient, national breed that is inseparable from our national identity," Rajabli said.

            <descricao>Europe faces challenges on many fronts - over Greece, on migrant crisis and from Russia, writes Simon Tisdall.</descricao>
            <corpo>Simon Tisdall is assistant editor and foreign affairs columnist at The Guardian. He was previously foreign editor of the Guardian and The Observer and served as White House correspondent and U.S. editor in Washington D.C. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his. (CNN)Has the post-war dream of a grand union of democratic states been shattered beyond repair? North American observers might be forgiven for thinking so, given the unprecedented tidal wave of public recriminations, personal insults, and dire predictions spewing forth from the European Union's panicky and divided leaders. The principal cause is the imminent climax to the crisis over Greece's undeclared, de facto bankruptcy. The country is ‚Ç¨323 billion ($352.7 billion) in debt -- more than 175% of its GDP. It cannot pay what it owes to other European countries and the European Central Bank. Its next big loan repayment, of ‚Ç¨1.6bn to the International Monetary Fund, falls due at the end of this month, and may be missed. The left-wing Syriza government, led by Alexis Tsipras, has confirmed Greece will run out of money by June 30 unless creditors release an additional ‚Ç¨7.2 billion in bail-out funds. Yannis Stournaras, Greece's central bank governor, warned that failure to reach a deal would "mark the beginning of a painful course that would lead initially to a Greek default and ultimately to the country's exit from the euro area and -- most likely -- from the European Union." If Greece is expelled or otherwise forced to drop out of the eurozone -- the group of 19 countries which have adopted the euro as their common currency -- the consequences could be catastrophic and far-reaching. For Greeks, it could trigger bank collapses, emergency controls on capital flight, non-payment of salaries, and broad social and economic chaos. For the EU, it could spell the end for the euro if market confidence fails and other severely indebted states decide they, too, can't or won't pay up. The crisis, ostensibly about money, has become increasingly political. Many in Germany, Greece's most powerful creditor, believe successive governments in Athens have behaved irresponsibly and should be made to pay the price, morally and fiscally. Andreas Scheuer MP, a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said: "The Greek government ... are behaving like clowns." For her part, Merkel wants a compromise in which Greece would agree more austerity measures in return for continued funding. She says Greece must stay in the euro, for she knows the stakes are high. Back in 2010 she warned that "if the euro fails, Europe fails," and that still seems to be her view. But Tsipras, who accuses creditors of "pillaging" his country, casts Germany in the role of domineering bully, a characterization that has strong historical resonance across Europe. Merkel's leadership is under challenge in another big crisis facing the EU -- one which is potentially even more destructive than Greece's bankruptcy. So far this year more than 100,000 migrants have traveled to Europe illegally across the Mediterranean from north Africa to Italy and Greece. Britain's Royal Navy, which is conducting search and rescue operations, estimates a further half-a-million refugees are waiting their chance in Libya. Overwhelmed by new arrivals, Italy is at odds with France and Austria, who have been turning back migrants heading north. Eastern European countries have rejected Merkel's idea of a mandatory quota of migrants for every EU country. Britain says it will not take any at all. And as talks this week again failed to forge a common policy, Italy threatened to "hurt" Europe for its irresponsibility by issuing all new migrants with visas, meaning they could potentially travel wherever they choose. This extraordinary surge of refugees fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and Somalia, together with repression and poverty in Eritrea and west Africa is unusual. But immigration, broadly speaking, has long been a divisive issue throughout the EU. It has fueled the rise of xenophobic, nationalist political parties from France and Britain to Finland and Poland that are antagonistic to the EU. At the same time, the economic recession after the 2008 global financial crisis that brought mass youth unemployment to many EU states has encouraged the formation of left-leaning populist movements. One such, the anti-austerity Podemos in Spain, is tipped to cause a big upset in elections later this year, just as Syriza did in Greece last year. These activists, of right and left, say the EU, under the doleful influence of conservative, penny-pinching Germany has become remote, uncaring, corrupt and self-serving. They say it ignores the needs and troubles of ordinary citizens (as in Greece). They demand social solidarity and jobs, not market-driven fiscal discipline. And they voted massively against politics-as-usual in last year's European parliamentary polls. But, they complain, Brussels has just carried on as normal, as though nothing changed. This grassroots upsurge in hostility to the EU and conventional party politics coincides with a third momentous challenge to the concept of a united Europe -- the decision by David Cameron's government to hold an in-out referendum on Britain's membership. Cameron's Conservatives say the EU must reform or die. One key proposal, linked to the immigration issue, is curbs on the free movement of people within the EU. The British move was initially greeted with patronizing complacency in Brussels, where officials suggested the UK, not the EU, was the problem. But it has become increasingly clear that there is a huge constituency throughout Europe for genuine reform, a perception confirmed again by this week's election in euroskeptic Denmark. Meanwhile, politicians in France and Poland, for example, are belatedly realizing that a British exit could seal Germany's dominance at their expense. They also worry how the EU can fend off Vladimir Putin's predatory Russia without Britain, Europe's biggest spender on defense and a key U.S. ally, riding shotgun. Europe is not over, yet. But it is in deep trouble. In the week that saw the 200th anniversary of the epic Battle of Waterloo, when Britain saved the continent from Napoleonic dictatorship, it is ironic that Cameron, not Merkel, may be emerging as the more in-touch leader who could, potentially, save Europe again.  </corpo>

            <descricao>The war of words between America and Russia is escalating. So, too, is the movement of methods of war -- from U.S. fighter jets to Russian nuclear weapons.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)The war of words between America and Russia is escalating. So, too, is the movement of implements of war -- from U.S. fighter jets to Russian nuclear weapons. So is an actual war imminent? No one in Russia, NATO or the United States has gone that far yet. Still, the rhetoric and actions from both sides have definitely ratcheted up in recent days, raising concerns of a new arms race -- if not worse -- amid tensions both sides blame on each other. The major players all claim their movements are defensive and necessary responses to their foe's provocation. None has talked of an invasion. READ: Air Force may send F-22s to Europe over Russia 'threat' Still, that's not what some experts are worried about. They say a bigger fear is what things can happen, accidentally, when you have increasingly powerful military forces lined up so close to each other. Part of it has to do with the unpredictable nature of other actors, like Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine who may broaden their own conflicts by inadvertently or purposefully striking others. The biggest such example may be the 2014 shooting down of a Malaysia Airlines commercial plane over Ukraine by rebels. Then there's the danger that something goes wrong as powerful militaries become more aggressive, as when a Russian fighter jet recently came within 10 feet of a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft over the Black Sea. "Given the tempo of Russian military operations over the last year," said Steven Pifer of the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank and a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, "you have more interactions, more possibilities for things to go wrong."  There's no doubt that the military tit-for-tat has picked up this week. The U.S. Navy is among those participating in a NATO landing exercise in Sweden. Around the same time, U.S. Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James announced that it could be sending some of its most advanced warplanes to Europe in a show of force. Already, the Pentagon has rotated B-2 and B-52 bombers, F-15Cs and A-10 attack planes as well as Army and Navy assets through Europe for exercises with allies under what's called Operation Atlantic Resolve. James said the F-22 Raptor, the Pentagon's premier fighter, could soon join them. This is all in addition to previous U.S. military actions in support of Ukraine and several Baltic countries, some of whom fear Russian President Putin -- either directly or indirectly -- will come after them next. In reaction, Russia's foreign ministry on Monday accused NATO countries of "sliding into a new military confrontation with destructive consequences." That's not to say Moscow hasn't taken military action of its alone -- most conspicuously with its aircraft. NATO announced late last year that it intercepted more than 400 Russian military planes in 2014 alone -- a 50% increase from the previous year. Then there was the Russian jet that in May came within 10 feet of an American military plane in international airspace above the Black Sea. "You don't have to fly 500 feet above a ship to do intelligence-gathering," Jorge Benitez, a NATO expert at the Atlantic Council, said. "(Putin) is trying to use these threats to push back on the West and say, 'I'm willing to do these things to get you out of my sphere of influence.'"  Russian President Vladimir Putin has given little impression he'll back down. "If someone threatens our territories, it means that we will have to aim our armed forces" toward the threat, he said Tuesday, according to state-run Sputnik news. "It is NATO that is coming to our borders, it's not like we are moving anywhere." READ: U.S., Russian aircraft came within 10 feet over Black Sea Putin upped the ante beyond provocative aerial maneuvers that same day, as he announced that he is buttressing his country's nuclear arsenal with an additional 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles. In response, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg criticized this "new nuclear capabilities and (increased use of) nuclear rhetoric," and warned, "The nuclear saber-rattling of Russia is unjustified, it's destabilizing and it's dangerous." James, the U.S. Air Force's top civilian leader, called Russian activity in Europe the "biggest threat on my mind" when she noted that the U.S. is considering sending its top F-22 fighter jets to the region. Russian officials, though, say they're the ones being threatened. That includes reports that the United States might deploy tanks and artillery to bases in Eastern Europe, a prospective move Russian Defense Ministry official Yuri Yakubov called "the most aggressive step by the Pentagon and NATO since the Cold War." Defense Secretary Ashton Carter will announce that decision next week, sources told CNN.  U.S. officials and observers point to the uprising in Ukraine as the start of the uptick in Moscow's confrontational behavior, which intensified amidst Western condemnation and pressure in the wake of Russia's seizure of Crimea. President Barack Obama has looked to bolster Ukrainian military efforts through non-lethal aid and training, as well as give political support to Kiev and place pressure on the Russians through a bludgeon of sanctions coordinated with EU partners. Obama has thus far resisted sending lethal aid to Ukraine -- an ally, but not a member of the NATO alliance. U.S. and European leaders are already considering an additional round of sanctions they would impose on Moscow if it makes further military moves in Ukraine. U.S. officials are particularly concerned by large-scale Russian military exercises near Ukraine set to take place this summer -- just the latest in a series of exercises that have come either close to the Ukrainian border or simulated military strikes, including nuclear strikes, on Europe. Western officials believe that they need to respond in kind -- and that's come in the form of increased NATO military exercises with Baltic allies like Estonia and the latest American plans to send artillery to bases in the region. "We want to make sure that NATO allies are defending their territory on a 24/7 basis and we'll continue to support them and exercise vigilance in that regard," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday about increased U.S. military engagement in the region. And while the U.S. looks to reassure Eastern European allies with these efforts, Russia's provocations continually unsettle those same countries, said Paul Stronski, who served as director for Russian policy issues on the National Security Council from 2012 to 2014. "When the West talks about upping its presence in the region, this is their response," he said. Nearly every American and European attempt at deterring Putin has instead triggered an opposite reaction: more military exercises, more provocative behavior and a persistent refusal to back down in the face of Western demands. "I think we're going to be seeing more and more of this," said Benitez, who is not alone in arguing that the Obama administration is not doing enough to beat back Russian aggression. Republicans in Congress and others in Washington are calling for Obama to green light lethal aid to the Ukrainians. Stronski, however, called for caution. "It's time that people start to show some political restraint to rein this in on both sides," he said.

            <cabecalho>9 Inspiring Instagram accounts from the silk Road  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>We take a look at some of the most breathtaking Instragram accounts from the Silk Road travelers' trail.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Winding its way roughly from China in the east, all the way to Italy in the west, the Silk Road has captured the imagination of travelers for centuries. Though to call it a single road is a little misleading -- it's actually a series of ancient trade routes stretching like veins across the globe. Encompassing an astonishing breadth of cultures, cuisines, and landscapes -- from the exquisite craftsmanship of Xi'an's terracotta army, to the gasp-enducing horsemanship of rural Kyrgyzstan, and the futuristic architecture of Astana -- it's little wonder travelers are still packing their bags for this colorful trail. We take a look at some of the best Instagram accounts from the region. Get ready for some serious travel envy.  Who: Yeatoeh Lhamo Penjore, 24-year-old teacher and part-time fitness model from Bhutan. My journey: Ever since the 4th grade I have been studying outside of Bhutan (India, New York, Singapore) so I suppose my love for travel and other cultures is because of that. Also, since I was out of my own country for so long I realized Bhutan has so much beauty. I enjoy taking pictures of Bhutan. Top Instagram tip: If you are passionate about what you do, your photos generally do the speaking.  Who: Thien Bui, 29-year-old Australian, previously working in the financial sector and currently taking a belated gap year to travel the world. My journey: I've been traveling for over a year now, starting my Silk Road adventure in Bishek, Kyrgyszstan. From there, I traveled over land through central Asia, Iran and Europe. I'm currently taking a break from traveling so I may work on a fresh itinerary exploring foreign lands. My plan is to hit the road again come July. Top Instagram tip: Forgo the selfie stick and point the camera the other way! On a more serious note, I approach my Instagram photos the same way I would with any photo -- thinking of composition, light, shadows and trying to capture the unique moments in my travels.  Who: Francesco Dominick Arbolino, 32-year-old American, currently full-time traveler. My journey: I've spent six months on this trip so far, but I have spent over four years traveling, having visited 88 countries. On this particular trip, I've visited Indonesia, Timor Leste, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. I'm motivated mostly by curiosity about countries that most people don't travel to. I also have a strong desire to interact with locals. I find this easier in less-touristy places. Top Instagram tip: If you like photographing architecture or landscapes, head out at sunrise for beautiful golden light and not many people to interfere with the composition. If photographing people is your passion, start shooting about an hour before sunset when many people are still on the streets and that golden light reappears.  Who: Sanjit Das, 39-year-old Indian photographer based between Malaysia and India. My journey: I am currently working on a photographic project documenting one river that crosses three countries - China, India and Bangladesh. It's an attempt to see how a river can influences cultures. Top Instagram tip: 1. Don't bombard your followers. 2. Give relevant information with what you're posting. People like to know what you sharing with them.  Who: Stefen Chow, 35-year-old professional photographer born in Malaysia, raised in Singapore, and now based in Beijing. My journey: I travel constantly -- around 100 flights per year -- though not too long that I miss my family terribly. I travel mainly for work and for my project: www.thepovertyline.net. Top Instagram tip: Be honest and who you are. I take pictures only when it inspires me personally.  Who: Jethro Mullen, 36, CNN.com journalist based in Hong Kong and focusing on news in the Asia-Pacific region. My journey: I moved from Europe to Hong Kong about five years ago and have loved exploring different parts of Asia, including Cambodia, Vietnam and Japan. Top Instagram tip: Get lost. Often the most interesting pictures are the ones you stumble across by chance.  Who: Alejandra Wilkinson , 27-year-old English-Venezuelan working in marketing in Hong Kong. My journey: Traveling and learning about new cultures has been part of my upbringing, as my father was always being moved around for work, so I love exploring new places -- and particularly different cuisines! Wherever I go traveling, I like to pick places where I know the food is going to be excellent. Top Instagram tip: Use a filter that's going to make it look cool, but that doesn't distort it too much from reality - if it looked good enough to take a picture of it in the first place, it'll look good even without a filter.  Who: Theodore Kaye, 34-year-old Taiwanese-American photographer. My journey: I travel on assignments mostly in east and central Asia, and have a long running interest in the post-Soviet "stans." Top Instagram tip: Mobile photography can help capture telling moments in daily life that we might not shoot - or share - otherwise.  Who: Will Kernick, 21-year-old British student and mountaineer. My Journey: I have spent the last three years traveling as frequently as possible to both Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. I am hoping to complete the formidable Snow Leopard Award (climbing the five 7,000 meter mountains in the former Soviet Union). Only a handful of westerners have climbed all five, and it is my ambition to become both the youngest ever and the first British person to do so. Top Instagram Tip: I am very new to this game, but you can't go wrong if you only attach your very best pictures that are particularly visually spectacular.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Hackers targeted air travel and successfully grounded around 1,400 passengers on Sunday. The problems for passengers started at Warsaw Chopin airport after the airline says hackers breached its ground computers, which are used to issue flight plans. The grounded airline, LOT Polish Airways, told CNN because of the attack it was unable to create flight plans for outbound flights from its Warsaw hub and as a result outbound flights from Warsaw were not able to depart. Poland's national flag carrier says it was forced to cancel 20 flights and several others were delayed on Sunday after suffering an attack on its IT system. Sebastian Mikosz, CEO of the Polish airline LOT, is warning all airlines are vulnerable. "Of course this is an industry problem, not a LOT problem but an industry problem on a much wider scale, and for sure we have to give it more attention, if it can be given more attention," he told Reuters. RELATED: Congressman proposes privatizing air traffic control Mikosz also said cyberattacks on aviation are an ongoing issue the industry will continue to deal with. "Because the attention is very high. And this is why I think we managed pretty quickly within a few hours to re-establish the functioning. But yes, I expect it can happen to anyone anytime," he said. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration requires all aircraft to file a flight plan before takeoff. Domestic flight plan information is used to track the flight of an aircraft for its protection and identification purposes. The information is used by air traffic controllers to make sure all flights in the air are on a safe path. In the event of a crash search-and-rescue, accident investigators, military, law enforcement, and the Department of homeland Security use the information as well. LOT's website now notes the problem is under control and its systems are now producing flight plans again. Potential cyberattacks on the aviation system has been an ongoing concern for an industry that relies on electronic systems for critical parts of their operations, including safety critical functions, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations sanctioned group designed to help develop global aviation standards. "Currently cyber security is a relatively minor issue in civil aviation, but this is changing," the international group said In a 2012 working paper. "Although the adoption of new technology is an ongoing activity in civil aviation, the current pace and extent of new information technologies is notably increasing the risk from cyberattacks." In April, a cybersecurity consultant was detained after tweets discussing hacking into the plane he was traveling on. He told the FBI he hacked into computer systems aboard airliners up to 20 times and managed to control an aircraft engine during a flight, according to federal court documents. RELATED: Researcher says new air traffic control system is hackable It is unclear if his claims are true, but cyberattacks are a real concern for the aviation industry. The type of hack LOT airlines experienced can cripple air travel for hours at a time. Analysts have said cyberattacks on aviation can have a physiological impact on passengers and their confidence in air travel and that can translate to an economic impact. Aviation is a huge economic driver and when the industry is disrupted, it can have a huge blow to the economy. U.S. civil aviation related economic activity generated $1.5 trillion and supported 11.8 million jobs in 2012, according to a 2015 FAA economic impact report.   </corpo>

            <descricao>Drones, remote tech and aircraft cabins of the future on the agenda at major aviation industry event</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)As the world's oldest and largest air show, the Paris Air Show is the undisputed queen of its kind. The tarmac of Paris-Le Bourget Airport is set, once again, to be heaving with manufacturers, military representatives, businessmen and the general public from across the globe. So what will the 51st edition of the biannual spectacle, which runs June 15-21, have in store? Here are five key trends I believe are likely to take center stage.  The link between air connectivity and global economic growth is profound, so it's no surprise to see the emerging economies of the world -- and those with fast growing middle classes -- experiencing the highest demand for aircraft and aerospace infrastructure. Asia is booming. The region is expected to represent two thirds of global aviation sector growth by 2034, so observers expect a flurry of orders from its airlines at Le Bourget. While such rapid regional growth is sensational to watch from the sidelines, there are a number of practical considerations for those supporting larger fleets of aircraft. Although the bulk of orders are coming from newer Asian markets, the infrastructure to support them is still mainly in Europe and North America. Maintenance, repair and overhaul support cannot operate effectively from a distance, particularly for short-haul aircraft that dominate the market by volume -- it has to be local. The development of regional hub networks is a crucial factor for expansion into these highly profitable regions, opening up opportunities to new players in the market. Maintenance of aircraft is one thing, but planes also have to be able to take off and land somewhere. The rapid population growth across Asian countries far surpasses the speed of the airport infrastructure development required to support it. In fact, the number of airports per million people in Asia represents a fraction of 1% -- far lower than in the West. Airport development and access to airports has to match and keep pace with population growth -- this is a much greater restriction on the region's development than the availability of aircraft. The logistics of this, and the need to provide sufficient airport infrastructure across the region, will be a major discussion point.  The Internet of Things isn't a new concept for the aviation industry. Sensors and digital automation have been common features within manufacturing and the operation of machinery for more than a decade. In recent years the surge of new and powerful technologies has opened commercial possibilities for aerospace and defense companies. One area evolving rapidly is technology that enables engineers to check on the performance of every mechanical component on board a plane. In the wake of the last year's spate of aircraft losses, renewed focus has been placed in this area. However, there's more work to be done before real time health monitoring from the skies becomes commonplace. I expect to see a plethora of companies working to push us closer toward comprehensive inflight monitoring and direct communication between aircraft sensors and operations on the ground. Within the next five years or so, I'd expect significantly more ground staff to have access to a constant stream of information, giving them continual and complete understanding of an aircraft's performance. What could this mean for the future? Were an engine to develop issues midair, could it be possible for a standby system to kick in and run crucial systems from the ground, enabling the flight to continue safely? The security and legal ramifications of remote operation are yet to be ironed out, and there are ongoing issues with bandwidth, but this is the direction the industry is moving. We'll likely see major technological developments from players at the cutting edge of this market at Le Bourget this year.  The mobile revolution has put a smart device in the hands of almost every airline passenger -- we expect to be online at all times. But only a fraction of air passengers can access the Internet. There's a huge drive to change this as airlines battle for "connected customers." Plans to roll out further "connected routes," especially on long haul flights, will certainly be on the agenda in Paris. I predict innovations around increasing bandwidth and in security -- an area that developers will be keen to address, as inflight connectivity invariably opens the door for potential hackers. Developments don't stop here. The notion of the connected flier brings with it a new technological trend: the integration of connected devices with the aircraft itself. This could be through phone or tablet apps that allow passengers to order food and drink, control inflight entertainment and adjust the lighting around their seat.  Aerospace interiors is a huge, exciting and innovative marketplace. Companies big and small are drawing inspiration from other areas, such as the automotive industry, to tackle a whole range of pain point issues in the aircraft cabin. We'll see a glimpse into the future of the cabin experience, as companies showcase solutions to issues of privacy and personal space, seat density, weight reduction and cabin ambiance. Airlines are under increased pressure to drive down cost and boost capacity while improving their share of the lucrative first- and business-class passenger groups. The trend for the likes of the Gulf carriers to adopt more advanced and luxurious options for upmarket passengers is set to continue. At the other end of the spectrum, ongoing demand for low-cost air travel will focus airlines on the clever use of space and weight distribution to accommodate extra seating. Between these two polar extremes of consumer travel, there's a growing trend toward using aircraft interiors to develop more intermediate classes. There's talk of the traditional three (first, business, economy) being expanded to five with the addition of two more premium economy options. Proposals for these will likely be on display at the Paris Air Show.  Drones and Unmanned Air Systems will continue to be a huge area -- the UAS market is possibly the fastest growing area in the aerospace and defense industries. What's so astonishing about this area is the breadth of its influence. In recent years the market has expanded from monitoring and bombing activity in war zones, to disaster relief efforts (most recently in the wake of the earthquake in Nepal), aircraft inspection for maintenance and the delivery of parcels. The technology, which will be on display in abundance at Le Bourget, is already mature, so the discussion is likely to focus on challenges surrounding its application, for example airspace access. The perceived lack of control and subsequent security issues in this domain have been demonstrated by recent near misses between drones and commercial aircraft, particularly in and around airports.

            <descricao>On June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, will welcome some 6,000 athletes.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into countries around the world. This time we travel to Azerbaijan in the lead up to the European Games to explore the culture of sports in the country sitting on the Caspian Sea. (CNN)This month marks the start of a new era: on June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, will welcome some 6,000 athletes to this inaugural sporting festival. The Games, which will take place every four years, were brought into being at a vote by members of the European Olympic Committee (EOC) in 2012 and announced at a meeting of the body's General Assembly in Rome that December. Thirty-eight of the 49 EOC members backed the Games, which provide a European equivalent of the multi-sport Asian Games and the Pan-American Games, both of which have been part of the calendar since 1951. Representatives of 50 European nations will compete, with the opening ceremony taking place on Friday June 12th and the closing ceremony being held on Sunday 28th. The committee said the event "is in no way intended to be a copy of the Olympic Games" and is "a tool with which to enhance the attractiveness of sport." Which sports are being showcased? The new Games will play host to some new disciplines after the Olympic Committee made its selection from an "overwhelming" number of suggestions. Twenty sports will be on the agenda -- 16 Olympic events and the other four making their debuts in this format. First, the familiar ones: aquatics, archery, athletics, badminton, judo, volleyball, boxing, canoe, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo, triathlon and wrestling will all be there. And what of the newcomers? Well, they're 3x3 basketball, karate, beach soccer and sambo. The first three are self-explanatory -- but what exactly is sambo? And how do you do it? Sambo has its roots in the military history of the Soviet Union, of which Azerbaijan was a part. A martial art, it was devised as an element of Red Army training in the 1920s with the intention of sharpening soldiers' hand-to-hand combat skills. Throwing, groundwork and submissions are all elements -- the sport has echoes of both wrestling and judo, but rules and restrictions are different -- and the name is a truncated version of the Russian for 'self-defence without weapons.' We can probably expect Russia to do well in this one. What are the incentives for athletes? They are twofold: both the winning of medals for their country and opportunities to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Baku will host 253 medal events, with direct Olympic qualification at stake in disciplines including the triathlon. What do we know about Baku? We know there had been initial thoughts that Russia and Turkey would be in contention to be host nation -- but Azerbaijan was the only bidder, and Baku, with a population of around 2.5 million, takes its place in the spotlight. The city, the largest in the South Caucasus and the biggest on the shores of the Caspian Sea, mixes the influences of east and west and, at the heart of an oil-rich nation, has plenty of conspicuous wealth: there are gleaming office towers and the boulevards at its center are home to high-end shops. Look beyond the shininess, though, and you'll find the true heart of the place -- the walled Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has its origins in the 12th century, while lush green promenades wind around the coastline. What does Azerbaijan hope to gain from hosting the Games? Azerbaijan wants to put itself and its capital at center stage, with sports minister Azad Rahimov saying in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: "The main important thing is to position our country on the map of the world and our country on the map of Europe. "The best instrument to do that is sport and culture. Sport has a bigger potential for reaching the most people." The Netherlands is set to host the second European Games, which will take place in 2019.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Russian President Vladimir Putin opened Patriot Park this week -- his country's version of a military theme park of sorts. </descricao>
            <corpo> Kubinka, Russia (CNN)A child plays on a war tank. People eat ice cream as they walk past weapons capable of destroying an entire continent. Tens of thousands fill a park full of Russia's latest military weapons: Helicopters. Missiles. Tanks. Boats. Submarines. This is the Disneyland of Russia's military. And right now in Russia, patriotism is in. Its President, Vladimir Putin, opened Patriot Park this week in the latest move to capitalize on the popularity in Russia of the country's recent displays of military force. We arrive after an hour's drive from Russia's capital city, Moscow. We park and take a bus into the main area where a huge exhibition of weapons and technology is on display. Most people here are families. A father is here with his son. "Russia is unbeatable" he says -- and he wants his son to learn it. The air of patriotism is palpable here. As people walk by in Putin T-shirts, we search for Putin souvenirs on sale. No luck. But we do find several shops run by the Russian army. They're quite popular. The shops sell camouflage jackets, fleeces, things like that. And to be honest, they're pretty stylish. It's all part of the effort to keep the military cool -- and reach out to the young. It seems to be working. Elsewhere there's a massive line of people queuing up for free army food. For the price of a wait, you can get a dollop of buckwheat porridge. More traditional fare seems hard to come by, though there are a lot of ice cream stands. We finally find a restaurant and I order a kebab with rice. Patriotic music blares nonstop. A stage hosts different acts: an air force choir singing, funky dancers dressed as Russian soldiers. Some children perform, too. A few foreign military types walk around. A Saudi Arabian Navy officer says they normally buy weapons from Americans -- but they are interested in the innovation here. We see uniforms of Venezuela and Myanmar, too. The park itself is massive. Our photographer takes a bus to a different area where there are live demonstrations. Re-enactments of key Russian and Soviet battles are expected to be a regular part of the Patriot Park experience. Here in the exhibition area, we see a Buk missile launcher on prominent display. This type of weapon is suspected of downing an airliner last year. MH17 crashed last July, killing 298 people on board. Children play happily on the weaponry and people seem to enjoy themselves. And yet there is something brazen, if not insensitive about the display. These are, after all, the tools of war -- killing machines really -- paraded as if they are toys and rides at an amusement park.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Pope Francis prayed Sunday before the Shroud of Turin, a strip of cloth that some believe was used for the burial of Jesus Christ. The shroud appears to bear the image of a man who resembles paintings of Christ. "The shroud attracts towards the face and the martyred body of Jesus and at the same time pushes us towards the face of those who suffer or are unjustly persecuted," the Pope said afterward at a Mass in Piazza Vittorio. "It pushes us in the direction of the gift that is Jesus' love."  It was the start of a busy day for the Pope as he made a pastoral visit to the city of Turin, in northern Italy. Later, he spoke with workers gathered in Piazzetta Reale. "A job isn't only necessary for economic reasons but for the human being, for his dignity, his citizenship and for social inclusion," the Pope told those gathered in the square. "Immigration increases competition, but we don't have to blame the migrants because they are victims of inequality, of this throwaway economy and the wars. "It's sad to see the spectacle of this last period, where human beings are treated as goods," the Pope said. He also spoke in support of women's rights and against job discrimination based on gender.  The Pope's schedule called for him to have lunch with prisoners at the Ferrante Aporti penitentiary, named after a 19th-century Italian educator and theologian. He was also slated to meet sick and disabled people at a church, followed by dinner at the residence of the archbishop. Scientists are divided over how the image became embedded in the linen and whether it is really Christ's death shroud. The Shroud of Turin was first heard of around the year 1360, according to the New Advent website. It says the authenticity of the shroud is "taken for granted" by the Holy See.  </corpo>

            <descricao>A smuggler boat captain who trafficks children into Europe explains why he does and why he blames the kids' parents.</descricao>
            <corpo>Burj Mughayzil, Egypt (CNN)On a sandy beach in one of the many inlets dotting Egypt's Mediterranean coastline two men are standing off to one side watching us interview families whose children have been trafficked into Europe. Eventually the taller of them begins to jump in. He starts shouting and explaining why he works on the smuggler boats carrying the human cargo into Europe. "What does the government do for us? We're fishermen but there's nothing to catch." The village, Burj Mughayzil, is essentially a smugglers' village. By their own count 2,000 young men and boys have disappeared. Some as young as 11 and 12, they are lured by the European dream -- but so many of them either end up in Italian jails accused of crewing the smuggling ships or killed in the crossing. We were hoping somewhere on the beach to find a crewman on a smuggling ship, someone who had made the journey and returned. We found two; the tall man and his slimmer friend, who told us they were a ship's mate and a captain. When I asked if they'd talk on camera they agreed. To our surprise they both asked to show their faces and to give their names. CNN has retraced the route traveled by the children from small villages on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, across the sea to Sicily by boat, then making their way to the Italian capital, Rome, where they fall victim to drug and prostitution rings. Thousands of children are risking their lives, falling prey to traffickers, for the dream of a better future for them and their families. Captain Mahmoud and Mohammed told us: "We work the ships. Me and a crew of 15 people. If the [Egyptian] government was helping us in any way we wouldn't be crossing in any way." The trips can take up to nine days on the open seas. The Egyptian Government says it has increased its vigilance along the coastline but still the smugglers are finding ways out. Sometimes he says, 20 boys are crammed on a tiny fishing boat fitted with an onboard motor, so they can be brought out to sea where he and his crew wait on a bigger boat which holds up to 600 people. 'It's risky for the boat and for everyone on it. We could be sentenced to 25 years or be executed if anything happens, God forbid, to anyone on board if it becomes a death trip." He also risks years in an Italian jail on the other side and a 15,000 euro ($17,000) fine for every single person on board. The fine can stretch into the millions, Italian authorities say. It's a risk he knowingly takes. Though, the captain says, leaving him and his men "to rot in jail," is not the solution. "There are big fish and there are small fish. The small fish are the ones who are in Italian jails. The big fish live freely here in Egypt, freely in Italy." Many of the parents claim it is the children themselves who want to go -- but teens we spoke to in Italy say their families expect them to work once they get to Europe and to send money home. Others admit Europe is seen as a way of earning the family much-needed cash but they say they didn't know about the trafficker gangs behind the smuggling routes. Yet others say they were deceived by the smugglers who make empty promises of opportunity across the Med. Authorities in both countries are clear, they say the parents are guilty -- at the very least -- of abandoning their children. The smugglers, Captain Mahmoud says, are very brazen. "We leave here at dusk, dawn, whenever. It doesn't matter if you know you are risking jail anyway. We'll have been paid -- us and the crew - 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,300) each. That feeds a crewman's family and kids for a month. Then after that, who knows? Risk it again or die of hunger." Egyptian minors have been flooding into Italy by the thousands according to the Italian Ministry of Labor, taking advantage of Italian laws that grant state protection to those under 18 who arrive in Italy unaccompanied. It's not just the passengers that are underage though; his crew often is as well. Captain Mahmoud says they are pressured by their families. "People here in this village, they're selling their kids. They think, 'we're 10 [people] and we can't find enough to eat. When we're nine, we can eat a little better. If we're eight, we can eat even better still. If two get locked up? Better than we all die together.' All the people in Italian jails? They're the victims of the parents here who can't afford to eat." I asked if they felt a responsibility for the people making the crossing, for those who have died. "How can we not?" he said. "If anything happens to them, it happens to us. If the ship sinks we drown together." His tall friend, Mohammed, talks over him, "How can we not be sad? These are our cousins, our brothers. I still see their faces." At the end of the interview Captain Mahmoud asks again if we're going to broadcast this, if his government will see this. I tell him, yes, we will. Good, he says. Let them hear the truth.

            <descricao>It's a variation on the informal street basketball played all over the world -- and now 3x3 is one of the star attractions at the first-ever European Games.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into countries around the world. This time we travel to Azerbaijan in the lead up to the European Games to explore the culture of sports in the country sitting on the Caspian Sea. (CNN)It's a variation on the sort of informal street basketball played all over the world -- and now 3x3 is one of the star attractions at the first-ever European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan. But what, exactly, does the game involve? As its name suggests, it's a pared-down version of the traditional five-a-side version, needing just three players on each team. That pared-down nature extends to the playing space, half the size of the court required for a full game and using only one hoop rather than two. The popularity of 3x3 has rocketed since the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) chose it as an alternative form of the game to be played at the 2010 Youth Olympics in Singapore.  Its large-scale roots, though, go back further than that: American organization Hoop It Up organized a major competition back in 1989, while similar events were held in the U.S. during the early 1990s. After making the decision to promote 3x3 for Singapore, officials worked on the compilation of a set of rules that could be applied just as well in international competition as they could in pickup street games. The result is a sport that just won't stop growing -- FIBA estimates that around 250 million people around the world enjoy 3x3, with more and more continuing to join a sprawling network of organizers, leagues and players. Azerbaijani athlete Amil Hamzayev, whose achievements in 3x3 include winning the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries twice, is one of those players. The 24-year old tells the official Baku 2015 website that one of the biggest challenges of playing 3x3 is the effect of weather conditions -- a hazard unknown, of course, to players of the indoor game. "I'm excited to represent my country in front of our national crowd," Hamzayev -- who names American legend Michael Jordan as his favorite basketball star -- says.  A word or two about those 3x3 rules: they're nice and easy. Baskets scored from inside the arc bring a point, while those scored from outside bring two. Games are played over a single period of 10 minutes and won by the first team to score 21 points or the team with the highest score at the end of the 10 minutes. If the scores are tied at the end of the 10 minutes, overtime is played and the winner of the game is the first team to score two points. And that's the only thing about 3x3 that doesn't appeal to Hamzayev. He would rather see the victors needing three, necessitating more than one basket -- but he admits he would have been all at sea without basketball. "I would probably have finished naval college and become a ship's captain by now," he says.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The body of former White House executive chef Walter Scheib was found Sunday in the mountains of New Mexico where he had gone hiking, officials said. Scheib, who served under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, has been absent since June 13 when he left to go for a hike alone on a mountain trail in Taos, New Mexico. He was later reported missing by a family member. On Thursday, investigators tracked Scheib's cell phone signal to a mountain in Taos, according to a press release from the New Mexico State Department of Public Safety. Scheib had recently moved to the area, according to Sergeant Elizabeth Armijo, a New Mexico State Police public information officer. Scheib's car was discovered by investigators Tuesday in a parking lot at the Yerba Canyon Trailhead. His body was discovered off the immediate trail approximately 1.7 miles from the base of a hiking trail. Scheib served as White House executive chef from 1994 to 2005. Scheib was personally hired by then-first lady Hillary Clinton, according to Scheib's official website. "Hillary and I are saddened by the tragic passing of former White House executive chef Walter Scheib," the Clintons said in a statement Monday. "Our family was grateful to have Walter with us in the White House for six years, where we and visitors from around the world loved his delicious and creative meals," the statement said. "Walter used his immense talents not only to represent the very best of American cuisine to visiting leaders, but to make a difference in people's lives across the country through his support of numerous charities. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and many friends. On Monday, former first Lady Laura Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy for Scheib's loved ones. "Walter was an outstanding talent. He prepared magnificent dinners for world leaders and delicious family fare for our family and friends," Bush said.

            <cabecalho>Opinion: Why so many shooters are male - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A combination of genetics, violent media and social conditioning of males creates a perfect storm for a country where guns are too easily available.</descricao>
            <corpo>James Garbarino is author of "Listening to Killers: Lessons Learned from My 20 Years as a Psychological Expert Witness in Murder Cases," and professor of psychology at Loyola University Chicago. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)It looks like it has happened again. A young male has allegedly killed. In this case it is nine people at a church in South Carolina. Anyone who is paying attention hears the news and thinks, "Here we go again." But why? After spending 20 years interviewing killers as a psychological expert witness in murder cases I have some thoughts about this. Males are disproportionately over-represented in the ranks of America's killers -- about 90%, in fact. Why is that? Some of it appears to lie in the biological vulnerability of males. About 30% of males (versus 9% of females) have a form of the MAOA gene that impairs their ability to deal effectively and pro-socially with stressful situations (like living in an abusive family). Thus, the vast majority of males who have this genetic vulnerability and who live in abusive families end up engaging in a chronic pattern of aggression, bad behavior, acting out and violating the rights of others by the time they are 10 years old. It's a childhood pattern that is often the gateway to seriously violent delinquency and perhaps murder. This genetic vulnerability is part of a larger pattern for males. But this is only a part, perhaps a small part, of the larger story. The reality is that males are also typically more immersed than females in a culture that glorifies and justifies violence, and particularly male violence. For example, the effect of TV violence upon aggressive behavior is about as strong as the effect of smoking in causing lung cancer: Most people who smoke don't get cancer, but smoking increases the risk significantly. Violent images are like smoking for the brain, but instead of the physical problem of lung cancer the result is the behavioral cancer of violent behavior. I have found in interviewing men in murder cases that virtually every act of violence "makes sense" to the killer. Therefore, in a very real sense there is no such thing as a "senseless act of violence." Inside the mind of the killer the act of lethal violence fits into an idea of right and wrong (whether we on the outside recognize that idea as delusional or not). This is vitally important, because as a society, we often "promote" the various socially toxic cultural messages to which boys and men are exposed -- racism, misogyny, the belief that "it is better to be mad than to be sad," and the like. These cultural messages and themes poison male consciousness. To put it bluntly, even "crazy people" act within a cultural framework. They respond to cultural scripts that tell them "if this, then that." Sadly, there is a long tradition of killing black people in America that resonates across the decades and centuries. This extends from the thousands lynched in the South until well into the 1960s, to the repeated shooting of unarmed black boys and men by police and civilians in recent years. The same goes for violence against women. Some males latch onto these scripts as a way to make sense of their lives, whether it be their anger, their resentment, their sense of entitlement, their sense of being belittled -- whatever it is in their individual or collective case. People die from these socially toxic ideas in the hands of troubled people. Then there is the matter of youth. In recent decades, neuroscience researchers have demonstrated that human brains do not mature fully until people reach their mid- or even late 20s, for the most part. These immature brains are particularly prone to make mistakes in interpreting the meaning of emotions in others, of judgment, and in assessing the risks and benefits of action. They suffer from problems with both "emotional regulation" (managing emotions effectively and realistically) and "executive function" (making well-reasoned decisions that guide behavior). When kids have had an accumulation of adverse childhood experiences, the odds that they will have problems with both emotional regulation and executive function increase. That's why wise parents, educators, professionals and policymakers recognize that kids need to be in a kind of "protective custody" in many ways and in many matters until they mature. Finally, of course, there is the matter of arming troubled young males with lethal weapons. It is the access to guns that makes young males so dangerous, especially when they are troubled, angry, or somehow "crazy." It is guns that make American suicide attempts so deadly (85% lethal vs. 10% for pills). It is guns that make domestic disputes so dangerous. It is guns that make cop-civilian confrontations so deadly. And it is access to guns that means racist ideologies in the heads of troubled young males too often leads to tragic ends like the nine dead bodies in a church in South Carolina, because "guns don't kill people; people with guns kill people."

            <corpo>Los Angeles (CNN)A small plane belonging to Academy Award-winning composer James Horner crashed in central California on Monday, killing the pilot. It is not known whether Horner, best known for scoring the movie "Titanic," was the person flying the plane. "He is an experienced pilot. He owns several planes. We have not heard from him," his lawyer, Jay Cooper, told CNN. The single-engine S312 Tucano crashed under unknown circumstances near Cuyama, about 60 miles north of Santa Barbara, on Monday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The pilot was the only occupant on board, the FAA said. The name of the victim will have to come from local authorities, the FAA said. CNN has reached out to Ventura and Santa Barbara counties for information. A person answering the phone at Horner's house asked for privacy, the Los Angeles Times reported. Horner won two Ocars for his work on the 1997 blockbuster"'Titanic" -- best original dramatic score and best original song for the Celine Dion classic, "My Heart Will Go On." He has been nominated for an Academy Award 10 times and has scored numerous blockbusters, including "Braveheart," "Apollo 13," "The Amazing Spider-Man" and "Avatar." "I am hoping with all my heard that James Horner was not in his plane this morning," singer Josh Groban tweeted. "RIP to the pilot that died. Just awful." The debris field from the crash was scattered across a roughly one acre area in a dry riverbed, said Mike Eliason, a spokesman for the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. The aircraft caught fire upon impact, and the flames spread to the surrounding vegetation, he said. Firefighters who arrived on the scene were able to quickly put the fire out, but the occupant of the plane had died on impact, Eliason said. CNN's Sam Stringer, Paul Vercammen and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>Washington (CNN)The first black Republican woman elected to Congress is returning $1,000 in donations from Earl Holt, the alleged white supremacist whose writings have reportedly inspired Charleston shooter Dylann Roof. A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Mia Love said Monday that she would be returning the three donations Holt made to her campaign immediately, after being contacted by CNN. Love made history last November when Utah residents selected her as the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. Holt, who is president Council of Conservative Citizens, donated thousands of dollars to Republican candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Rick Santorum in previous elections. RELATED: Nikki Haley calls for removal of Confederate flag The Southern Poverty Law Center identifies the Council of Concerned Citizens as a hate group. The group, on its website, formally denounced the killings in Charleston last week, but Holt wrote in a post that Roof and others had "legitimate grievances" based on alleged black-on-white violence. The presidential donations were first reported by The Guardian on Sunday. Holt gave $1,750 to Paul and $8,500 to Cruz's campaign and super PAC. A Paul spokesman said Monday that the Holt donations would be given instead to to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund to assist families of the victims. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler said that they didn't have time to return the donations to Holt and instead donated $11,000 to the Mother Emanuel Hope Fund. Santorum's campaign said they would also donate the money to the fund. Holt has given $62,500 to top-name Republicans since 2010, according to federal records, including $2,000 to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. He also donated $1,000 to former U.S. Rep. Allen West, the black Republican congressman from Florida. Tea party-backed candidates, including Paul, Cruz, Santorum and others have been the biggest beneficiaries of Holt's donations. Holt also donated to the failed bids of tea party stalwarts Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock.  </corpo>

            <descricao>An E. Coli scare has prompted Niagara Bottling to recall 14 brands of its water</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)An E. Coli scare has prompted a Canada-based bottled water producer to recall some of its products. Niagara Bottling LLC said the recall is purely out of an abundance of caution. There have been no signs of its product being contaminated or reports of consumers falling sick, it said. The family-owned company said the operator of a spring that supplies two of its plants failed to report evidence of E. Coli at the source. The bottler said it halted production, disinfected bottling lines and issued a voluntary recall. The recall affects water bottled from June 10 through 18 in two Pennsylvania plants only. Niagara has issued instructions to consumers on its website on how to properly read the date on bottle labels to determine if purchased water should be returned. Consumers won't find mainstream brand names on Niagara's recall list, which includes mostly store and generic labels: Acadia, Acme, Big Y, Best Yet, 7-Eleven, Niagara, Nature's Place, Pricerite, Superchill, Morning Fresh, Shaws, Shoprite, Western Beef Blue and Wegman's. There are many types of E. Coli bacteria, some of which are not harmful to people and are commonly found in human intestines, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But some strains cause diseases that can be deadly, if ingested by humans. Public water works and water bottlers typically filter and disinfect their water to rid it of debris and contaminants, including bacteria. Niagara said it routinely tests spring source water and its finished product to ensure its safety. The company said it has detected no E. Coli contamination in either.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Most diverse place in America is not where you think - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A neighborhood in Anchorage lies in the most diverse census tract in America and life there is far from the stereotype of Alaska.</descricao>
            <corpo>Anchorage, Alaska (CNN)The shelves at the Red Apple Market are a giveaway. Dried squid. Sambal Olek chili paste. Corned Australian mutton. Canned grass jelly. Another clue: Ride the crowded No. 45 bus, which meanders down Mountain View Drive, and you hear chatter in seven languages -- none, English. That these markers of diversity are in a neighborhood in Anchorage may surprise folks from the Lower 48 who picture Alaska as a largely homogenous and snowy American extremity. But Alaskans are quite proud of their distinctive demographics. Remember Sarah Palin's much-parodied 2008 interview with Katie Couric? One segment ended with this line: "Believe me, Alaska is like a microcosm of America." Palin was taken to task for her claim because Alaska's black and Latino populations are lower than the national average. And yet ... Mountain View, a northeast Anchorage neighborhood, boasts the most diverse census tract in all of America. That's according to University of Alaska sociology professor Chad Farrell, who analyzed the census data. In fact, Farrell says the country's three most diverse census tracts are all in Anchorage, followed by a handful in Queens, as in New York, which usually tops everyone's diversity guess list. Mao Tosi, an American Samoan and former NFL defensive end, returned to Mountain View after his career with the Arizona Cardinals ended. He wanted to be a part of this rapid change and help the Samoan community assimilate. "This place is a snapshot into America's future," says Tosi, his 6-foot-6 frame casting an imposing shadow in the Northway Mall that he operates. He speaks of a future in which America will no longer be majority white. Most predictions say that will happen by the middle of this century, and Tosi thinks the nation can take a cue or two from Mountain View. "Kids are growing up here without knowing the color of their skin," he says. "They are more influenced by what their neighbor is doing."  So how exactly did Mountain View score so high in diversity? Farrell explains the index he used to measure diversity: He looked at the number of ethnic and racial groups, but more importantly, he studied their size relative to one another. Farrell found that two things boosted Mountain View to the top. First, there is a sizable white population left. In many other places, neighborhoods that have increased in diversity have also seen white flight. Not so in Mountain View. Mountain View also has a significant Alaska Native population, which other cities in America lack. Alaska's diversity has spiked in recent years for a host of reasons. Among them are its economy, which prospered when other states were reeling from recession, because it is driven by fishing and oil. The state is also home to nine military bases, and Mountain View butts up to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Hawaiian businessman William Hoopai recently opened a new restaurant on the main drag called West Berlin. Yup. Schnitzels and sauerkraut attract a lot of uniformed men and women who have spent time in Germany. And there has been new immigration to Alaska -- including refugees from troubled nations such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Cuba, Iran and Bhutan. Many have resettled here in Mountain View. Omima Adam, a civil engineer from Sudan, arrived in 2010. "I was so shocked when I saw all that snow," she says from the window of her food truck, Sultan Shawarma, parked between a Dominican place and an espresso stand. "But I'd rather be cold than dead," she says of the bloodshed in her native Darfur. She learned English and puts her heart and soul into her kibbes, shawarmas and falafel. She wants to turn the business into a full-fledged restaurant and return to college to earn an engineering degree that the United States will recognize. Mountain View was her new beginning.  It's obvious this is not a wealthy place. Between the colorful new houses built by Cook Inlet Housing Authority lie scarred and tattered structures with molting paint and boarded windows. Mountain View Boulevard is lined with stores such as Price Busters and Cash America Pawn. The big anchor stores all abandoned Northway Mall, Alaska's first enclosed one. The last census counted 39% of households as earning less than $25,000; 19% fall below the poverty line. That explains why Alice "Mother" Lawrence's house is full every afternoon. The 79-year-old runs a nonprofit that collects foods that have exhausted their shelf lives in local groceries and distributes them to the hungry. Bread, pastries, fruits, vegetables, snacks, soft drinks. She landed here in 1967 as a military wife. She had a lot of kids and after her first husband left her, she learned how to get tough. "No one helped me here," she says. "They wouldn't give me a penny." That's when she found the Lord and her calling in life: to help the needy. She acquired a Casio keyboard and lined up seven church pews in her living room to minister to the poor. Her son, Randy Lawrence, says people he knows in other states say: "What? There are black people in Alaska?" Mountain View's census tract is 13.1% African-American, which is about the national average. Lawrence, 49, describes Anchorage as a wannabe bad-ass city. "It's not," he laughs as he unloads boxes of day-old cinnamon buns. "As for Mountain View? It's the 'hood. This is as bad as it gets around here." Yeah, there's gangs and drugs and other kinds of crime that's inextricably linked to poverty. But he likes living in a smaller place that is so racially mixed. "As a black man, I have to say you got a better shot at life here," he said, comparing it with New Jersey, where he was born. Carnard Davis, 44, agrees. He moved here from the now-demolished Bowen Homes housing project in southwest Atlanta and works at the Boys and Girls Club, where he's simply known as Mr. C. "I came here on vacation and saw how smooth and easy it was here," he says. "And I wanted a change." The club is full on this cold afternoon with kids from at least a dozen places. They don't all speak English well, but Davis says it doesn't matter. On the wall is a poster board with the question: "What does this place mean to you?" Many of the answers say, "family." One says: "This is a place I can be me."  Mountain View wasn't always a global petri dish. It grew up as a first-ring suburb that was annexed by Anchorage in the 1950s. It boomed as the place that accommodated transient oil workers who came for jobs on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The history is reflected in Mountain View's housing, a low-cost stock that consists of numerous duplexes and apartment complexes, which in turn attracted people looking for low-rent places in a state where high construction costs make decent housing expensive. After the pipeline was finished, Mountain View fell into decline. Crime soared in the 1980s and 1990s and the neighborhood got a bad rap. Architectural designer Clark Yerrington moved here in 1999 and recalls how his friends were shocked. It was common to hear people in Anchorage at that time say: "Never move into a neighborhood that ends with 'view.' " Mountain View and Fairview, named for their proximity to the Chugach Mountains, had become unsafe. In the height of the crack cocaine era, the blocks around Yerrington's house were "switched on all night." "It was sketchy," says Yerrington, who is white. "I moved here because it was affordable. I did not expect to be here long." His friends refused to visit him. But he's glad he stayed. Mountain View has been bouncing back in recent years, says Kirk Rose, executive director of the Anchorage Community Land Trust, which has purchased and rehabilitated properties and encourages revitalization. A credit union converted an eyesore gas station and opened the first financial institution around these parts. Before that, there were only pawn shops that charged 20% for cashing a check, Rose says. "The credit union has added 3,000 new accounts," he says. And growth around Mountain View has helped. Olive Garden opened last year (a big deal), and now clothing giant H&amp;M has announced it's coming to Anchorage (an even bigger deal). That's the buzz on the street. Key to Mountain View is its strong housing authority, which has shepherded construction of affordable homes. One reason the homes are cheaper is because buyers only pay for the house. The housing authority owns the land. The better housing has helped change the neighborhood from being largely transient to one where people want to stay, Rose says. "And that is so important for the health of a community." Yerrington proudly displays a collection of photos on his dining room wall. They are of houses in Mountain View, each a representation of a place he finds unique. There's no white part of town. No Aleut village. Or Chinatown. There are no set patterns. "We all live together. Even white people like me. Think how it would be if the whole country had been organized like this. It does people good to break out of their comfort zone and mix with neighbors who are different." And there's one more thing. It's Alaska. Yerrington's home is surrounded by wilderness and wildlife. Mountains and moose. He can't think of another place in America quite like this.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Rudy Tanzi is one of the world's foremost Alzheimer's researchers. But he also  moonlights with Aerosmith.</descricao>
            <corpo>A music legend fights Alzheimer's disease on his unforgettable farewell tour. CNN Films Presents: "Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me," Sunday, June 28 at 9 p.m. ET. (CNN)When Aerosmith looked for an organist to play like a "drunken church lady," they could have taken their pick from hundreds of willing candidates. But only one was also a Ph.D-wielding expert on how beta amyloid accumulates in the brain. That's who the band went with for their latest album. Legendary Aerosmith lead guitarist Joe Perry met keyboard player and pioneering scientist Rudy Tanzi exactly where you'd expect two world famous people from different worlds to meet -- on a photo shoot for the men's fashion magazine GQ. On the shoot, the two started chatting. Tanzi mentioned he played keyboard, so Perry invited him to jam with the band. The two hit it off so well that since then, the Kennedy Professor of Neuroscience at Harvard has been invited to play with Aerosmith on a number of special occasions. His initial direction, he recalled, was to play like a "drunken church lady." "It's been such fun," Tanzi said. But his true life's work -- or at least the job he is most famous for -- is what he does as director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit in the MassGeneral Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital. Tanzi is one of the world's leading authorities on Alzheimer's disease. Since the mid-1980s, he has been an unstoppable force trying to understand the genetics of the disease that plagues 5.2 million Americans. As in his musical life, Tanzi is known in the lab for his innovative improvisation and for using an unexpected kind of creative thinking. That's why he may be the only scientist in the world who credits early-morning bus rides and watching a cheesy '80s television show as part of his first big break. The chromosome 21 guy Long before Tanzi was named to the Harvard 100 Most Influential Alumni -- along with such notables as President Barack Obama and Microsoft co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates -- he was just some kid sitting on the back of a bus doing his homework. It was the early 1980s, and he was living in Providence, Rhode Island. He kept a grueling daily routine: He'd stay up late playing gigs with his rock band, then rise early to catch a bus to make an hour-plus journey to Boston to work in James Gusella's lab. Gusella pioneered the use of DNA sequence polymorphisms as genetic markers at his lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. That essentially means Gusella was one of the first scientist to figure out how to map the genes of a disease. "Jim Gusella and I were just kids in our 20s, trying to figure it all out," Tanzi said. "Back then, before genetics became a real industry, you had to jerry-rig everything. To take pictures of DNA, I brought in a Polaroid camera my father gave me for my 13th birthday and I'd put it on a ring stand and I took the red acetate we would use from the light show for my band and it put in the lens. I'd take some of the maps from the dermatology labs to light up the DNA. That was the humble beginning of the human genetics revolution." On his bus ride, Tanzi would start his complex calculations. He was trying to build a full map of a chromosome to understand the mechanics of Huntington's disease. "I wanted to get finished fast so I picked the smallest one to map, which is chromosome 21," he said. Tanzi says the bus had its regulars with their routines. "They'd be drinking their coffee and get on the bus and say, 'Hey Rudy, how's the map going?' And every day, I'd say, 'Gettin' there. We're gettin' there.' " There was no computer program to help back then. So Tanzi did all the tedious work by eye and by hand. "I would sit there with these huge family trees on my papers and I would track genetic markers and I would know who had the disease in the family and who didn't," Tanzi said. One night, when he was lying on the red shag carpet back in his Providence apartment, he took out those family trees. "I'll never forget I was watching 'Love Boat,' " Tanzi said. "And occasionally I'd look up to see Gopher running around the ship and then look down to write down all the information onto this family tree, then I'd look back up and Gopher was still running around the ship, and then I'd go back to my calculations. "After just a little while of doing this I thought to myself, 'My God, this is perfectly lining up. I think we may have found the Huntington's disease gene.' I'm not sure if Gopher ever stopped running around that ship, though." It turned out his calculations were right. His work earned Tanzi and his project director some renown. "I was just the hands on the project. It was Guesella's brain that made this happen, but it was so cool to actually do the work and to experience this kind of 'aha' moment for the first time," Tanzi said. "Plus, for a while I became known as the chromosome 21 guy, at least for a few years." Tanzi was hooked, and his knowledge of chromosome 21 would open more doors to his life's work. Stealing who you are "Back then there was so much optimism that we could find human genes that cause disease," Tanzi said. Working on chromosome 21 led him to study Down syndrome -- those with the condition have an extra copy of chromosome 21, along with an increased risk for Alzheimer's. "So I said, if I have a map for chromosome 21, maybe there's an Alzheimer's gene on this chromosome. So I decided to switch to Alzheimer's," Tanzi said. That was around 1983. "And from there I've never turned back." At the time, he said, he knew no one with Alzheimer's. "Sometimes in the lab you do these things like you are solving a puzzle and you don't experience the human side," Tanzi said. But only a short time into the work, he got some terrible news. His beloved paternal grandmother was becoming increasingly confused. It was soon suspected she had Alzheimer's. "It's amazing how as a scientist you become so much more inspired to solve that disease and to work harder and faster by seeing that disease eye to eye, especially in a loved one," Tanzi said. His grandmother quickly went from being friendly and doting to someone who sat stonefaced, unable to recognize her family. He says often he will invite families who have relatives struggling with the disease to talk with his students at Harvard. "What you see is that this disease is really the worst thing you can imagine," Tanzi said. "Because you spend your whole life -- decades and decades -- accumulating memories and association, and you develop a personality of who you are based on your experience and memories. And this disease comes in and rips all that right out. So it literally steals who you are from you. There is no other disease that does that. There is nothing worse." Spurred on by these examples, he worked with urgency. By 1986, all those long hours in the lab paid off. "I remember that day," Tanzi said. "We were looking through this one gene we found, and we said, 'Wow, this is matching up pretty well. The protein this gene makes looks exactly like the amyloid that we see in Alzheimer's.' " Amyloid is an abnormal protein that starts to build up in the brain in Alzheimer's cases. "When we saw this gene, I remember thinking, 'For the first time since Dr. (Alois) Alzheimer described amyloid in 1906, I think we have finally learned something new about the disease. We now have a gene.' " But his celebration was short-lived, he said. "Little did we know that there were three other groups who'd found the gene over the summer of 1986 and we all published at the same time in February of 1987, but it was still a good moment for us. It meant finally now we have a target for drug discovery." How to take 'shots on goal' Since then Tanzi and his lab have found several other genes related to Alzheimer's, and they are starting to get a clearer picture of how the disease works. His lab is a creative place. He tells his students when they walk in the door that they've got to be willing to trust their intuition and to take whatever their pet theory is and try to "bash your hypothesis and see what holds up in the end." Even its building is unique -- the lab is tucked in an old brick shipping building. From his window, Tanzi can watch the tourists go by in duck boats, taking pictures as they travel along the Mystic River. His office wall is covered with only a small representation of his many awards, and it is dominated by a beautiful black-and-white photo of his then-baby daughter asleep across his arms while he plays the piano. From this office, he strategizes about the next steps in his race to find a cure. He keeps a big red button on his desk that says "no" when pushed. As a joke, he brings it out when his grad students come in to ask for expensive equipment. From here, he also makes calls and answers e-mails about his many other projects. There's the New York Times bestseller, "Superbrain," that he co-wrote with new-age doctor Deepak Chopra and the successful PBS show that went with it. There are the small pharmaceutical companies he's co-founded to explore possible Alzheimer's cures and treatments. There is the work he does as chair of the Cure Alzheimer's Fund, which aims to fund new studies concerning the disease. And there is the political consulting he has done with the White House, which has set a goal of curing the disease by 2025. Alzheimer's has generated a lot of bad news in the past few years. A number of drug trials have failed recently. The handful of drugs that do exist can slow -- but not stop -- some early symptoms, and even then, only work in less than half the patients. Tanzi, though, believes that with more funding, a cure is possible. "In general, drug discovery usually takes two or three waves to get there," Tanzi said. "The first wave already failed. The second wave largely failed, but there is a bit of hope in there. Generally, though, with this third wave that's coming up in the next few years, I think we've learned from our mistakes and I remain optimistic. "The good news is, largely due to genetics, we know what we need to do. And we have the information that says 'Here's how we take the shots on goal.' "  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>We should on prison culture, not Joyce Mitchell (opinion) - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>We should stop focusing just on Joyce Mitchell and consider the lack of oversight and dismal prison culture that let inappropriate relationships flourish</descricao>
            <corpo>Editor's Note: Stephen McGuinn is an assistant professor of criminal justice at Quinnipiac University. Before pursuing his doctorate in criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland, he worked as a mental health professional and as an assistant unit chief on Rikers Island in New York City. His book, "Prison Workers, Prison Management, and Prison Theory" was published earlier this year. (CNN)When I worked on Rikers Island as a mental health professional, one of the clinic supervisors used to muse about our fellow employees: "Don't blame me, they work here because they cannot work anywhere else." Since we both worked there, I found the perspective humorous -- but not entirely untrue. After all, who wants to work in prison? Indeed, it is not the career choice of most of my criminal justice students. Prisons are fierce instruments of punishment, and they often house dangerous men and women. Prison worker Joyce Mitchell allegedly aided two such dangerous men in their escape from a maximum-security facility in upstate New York and had prior inappropriate relationships with them. But we miss the point if we make Joyce Mitchell the story. As the case continues to unfold, the media hurricane will probably target her weakness, her vulnerability and her foolishness. She was foolish. But informal and inappropriate relationships do and will happen in these environments unless overseers design and enforce strict precautions and regulations. It takes an entire culture to defend against these misplaced alliances. The prison itself must demand and inspire professional conduct. This is no easy feat. Although it is preferable for prison workers to detach themselves emotionally in the prison setting, daily interactions with confined populations make many people realize that prisoners are people, many of whom have suffered incredible disadvantages and lived tragic lives. Different opportunities may have generated very different outcomes for these men and women. It is easy -- perhaps even humane -- to see them for whom they could be. Acting on this vision, however, as Joyce Mitchell allegedly did, is severely misguided. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine if hired workers will become susceptible to such manipulation, and screening applicants more thoroughly will likely not prevent this behavior. Prison workers spend a great deal of time in close proximity to prisoners. It is likely that boundaries begin to erode long after the initial interviews. Prison impacts both workers and prisoners. If we make Joyce Mitchell the story, then we make the story too simple -- about a vulnerable female prison worker in a maximum-security, male facility. We isolate her as the embodiment of defenselessness while somehow excusing and overlooking the remaining workers. But there are no exceptions in prison work -- everyone is susceptible to manipulation, and the best defense against it is intensive supervision and a strong cultural dynamic that the prison administration generates. We must learn from her highly publicized and dangerous mistake. This is about promoting a culture that defends itself -- not about isolating and targeting an individual as the problem. Since prison administrators can only hire those who apply, it is necessary for them to supervise and train with the understanding that some individuals who join this applicant pool could compromise effective prison management. The solution is to ensure those who work in prison are monitored closely -- given weekly or even daily briefings about the specifics of their tours and daily challenges -- and are empowered to make decisions that reflect the needs of the state and not their individual desires. If the charges are true, it appears Joyce Mitchell elevated her own needs over the needs of the state. Prison administrators can dictate culture through intensive supervision and training. But in order for this effort to work, the culture requires a fair and consistent message from administrators that prioritizes the work of correctional officers, emphasizes humane treatment, understands the hardships that workers face, rewards workers for quality oversight through advancement and disciplines negligent and inappropriately physical supervision. Prison workers will subscribe to the mission and purpose of the prison if they perceive that it is legitimate, fair, equal and empathetic. If supervisors work to empower prison workers and elevate their service work, prison workers will be dedicated to its purpose and ensure that the formal and official culture is maintained. In this climate of improved oversight, Joyce Mitchell's conduct would have likely been formally recognized, and administrators would have dismissed her. Ultimately, to protect prisoners and prison workers, the culture of the prison must police itself. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>Charleston's battle-hardened civil rights activists say the shooting at Emanuel AME Church reopened wounds that were long lurking beneath the surface.
</descricao>
            <corpo>Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Bill Saunders can still hear the officer's words in his head: "You don't belong here." That was decades ago. But last week, news that a gunman spewing racist hatred attacked a church in his community took him right back to that day, when he had returned from fighting in Korea and was told he had no right to be inside a bus-station waiting area in his own country. Now Saunders proudly displays photographs of famous civil rights figures like Rosa Parks in his office. And he points to newspaper articles about struggles he's helped fight -- and won -- like a 1969 hospital workers strike in Charleston. The 80-year-old longtime activist and founder of the¬†Committee On Better Racial Assurance says he means it when he¬†calls himself a troublemaker in Charleston. "I've made a lot of enemies here," he says. "And I say I made them because I came after them before they came after me." But the shooting at Mother Emanuel, he says, has pushed him toward a haunting realization. "I've been crying a lot, a hell of a lot," he says. "I keep playing back tapes in my head and realizing that we have not come anywhere." His whole life -- ever since that day at the bus station -- Saunders says he's been fighting to be seen as a man. It's a goal that he says feels out of reach now, more than ever, in this state where the Confederate flag still flies proudly and a deranged racist can still slaughter innocent people in a brazen church attack. "One of the things I wanted all my life is to be a man, not a black man, but a man. There's no way I can ever be a man in Charleston, South Carolina," Saunders says. "I will always be a boy to the system. "I really wanted to die free. But that's not going to happen in my lifetime."  Speaking shortly after the shooting this week, Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley vowed that his city would remain resilient and come together. "This hateful person came to this community with some crazy idea that he would be able to divide," he said. "And all he did was make us more united, and love each other even more." But talk to some of the area's most battle-hardened civil rights activists and you'll hear hints of a more complicated story The shooting, they say, has exposed wounds that were long lurking beneath the surface in a city where racial divides remain a reality -- hidden, but unhealed.  "History is sort of repeating itself. ... It's disturbing," says William Pugh. For the soon-to-be high school senior, the fight against racism in his home state has become more than just a chapter in a history book. Last year, the football coach at his North Charleston high school was fired after word spread that the team had a ritual it followed after defeating predominantly African-American schools: smashing watermelons with caricatures drawn on them while making monkey noises. Students spoke out afterward -- but not in the way Pugh expected. A lot of them, he says, were quick to criticize the school administration for firing the coach.¬† That's when Pugh joined the fray, writing a letter to the editor of his school newspaper. "No one has stood up to tell them that their actions were wrong, and it's time for that to change," he wrote. After this week's shooting, Pugh says he sees hope in the tragedy. "I just hope that this can be used as catalyst for change," he says, adding that it's time for young people to pick up where past generations left off. "It's going to take their wisdom," he says, "but our energy."  In a wooden pavilion, behind an orphanage that's helped young African-American children in the Charleston area for more than a century, gospel music plays as the faint smell of ocean water lingers in air that is heavy with history. This warm Saturday afternoon was supposed to be a day for joyful celebration: the annual marking of Juneteenth -- the day a century and a half ago when the last slaves in the United States finally gained their freedom. When the shooting at Charleston's Mother Emanuel sent shock waves through their community, the organizers debated whether they should cancel. Sara J. Nesbit knew that wasn't an option. So in addition to a festival with traditional music and dancing, she booked guest speakers to talk about the impact of the shooting. It was a natural fit, Nesbit says. Juneteenth, after all, celebrates the emancipation of a people whose rights were violated. "It all ties in," she says. "We are still being violated." A woman comes to the podium and says she's proud to be from Charleston, but adds that the area's residents from different cultural backgrounds need to take more steps to find common ground. "We don't know each other if we don't sit down with each other and hear each other's stories," she says. A few minutes later, Nation of Islam Minister DeAndre Muhammad warns the crowd not to be complacent. "This city will not have a race war, they say. But we must realize that we were victims of war as soon as the soles of our forefathers' feet set foot on the United States of America," he says. "We are casualties of war." The gunman in last week's attack clearly picked his target with history in mind, says Damon L. Fordham, and history should be part of how we process what happened. The shooting at Mother Emanuel, the historian says, harkens back to the high frequency of attacks on black churches decades ago. But for Fordham, who's spent years studying African-Americans in South Carolina, the issues at play in this most recent attack go far beyond the state's borders. "Let's not kid ourselves. The problems are not geographic. ... There are no utopias on this Earth. This is not strictly a race problem," he says. "This is also a human problem and a global problem."  The shooting at Mother Emanuel devastated Minerva Brown King. But somehow, she wasn't surprised. A week ago, the 70-year-old high school librarian was telling her friends at a church book group that something serious was simmering beneath the surface in their city, and something terrible was bound to happen soon. "I saw it coming. I heard it. I smelled it. I felt it coming," she says. "I've been in this community long enough to feel the rumblings, the lack of true communication." She wishes she hadn't been right. She knew four of the nine people killed in Wednesday's attack. "It's just so bad that we have to live through tragedies like this to get people's attention," she says. "It's right there in front of us. We've just ignored it for so long." It's been more than five decades since King sat at the S.H. Kress &amp; Co. five-and-dime store in Charleston with her high school classmates, watching a waitress pour ammonia over the counter in an attempt to get out of serving them, in what became the city's first civil rights sit-in. It's been decades since she saw crosses burning on her family's front lawn as nightriders targeted her father, the head of Charleston's local NAACP chapter. It's been decades since she met in marathon sessions with groups of civil rights activists inside Mother Emanuel, making picket signs and planning their next move. And until recently, it had been decades since she'd marched. Her concerns about what she says are Charleston's increasingly segregated schools brought King back to the streets several months ago. Then the April shooting death of Walter Scott, which drew national attention after a video surfaced showing a police officer gunning him down, further fueled her fervor. Now, she frequently finds herself wearing a T-shirt that says, "DO YOU BELIEVE US NOW?!" in bold white block letters on a black background. The message, she says, refers to complaints North Charleston's African-American residents made for years about excessive police force. It wasn't until the video of the police shooting emerged, she says, that anyone took them seriously. You don't have to travel far to see reminders of the struggles in Charleston's past. The longtime site of slave auctions is now a city-run museum. And signs in some of the city's most popular tourist areas document civil rights landmarks. On the surface, it might seem the city's racial divides are relics of the past. But it's not the obvious signs that you have to worry about, King says. It's the more insidious ones, according to King -- like increasingly segregated schools and gentrification that's drastically changed the city's demographics, sending most African-Americans into neighboring North Charleston. Politicians claim the Mother Emanuel attack "is the act of one deranged person," she says, "and that is so untrue." Officials, she says, are still fostering a climate that feeds hate in Charleston -- and beyond. "I want the governors and the mayors to start taking some responsibility for how they have contributed to the situation," she says. Until they do, and until people start being more honest when talking about race, King says, she'll keep marching. Right now, she says, it makes sense that people are flocking to the historic church in mourning. But King is ready to shift gears. "That can't be the end of the struggle," she says. "That should be the beginning." CNN's Deborah Brunswick contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Ten people, including three children, were shot at a Philadelphia cookout and block party Saturday night. According to Philadelphia police incident report, witnesses said "that two unknown black males had fired (at the crowd) with a shotgun at least once and then (drove) down the street in a gold or silver four door sedan and fired several more shots, possibly with a handgun." "It looks like they just fired randomly into the street and hit whoever was in their way," said Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker. "It's a terrible situation." Victims' injuries included gunshot wounds to the leg and face. The youngest victim, an 11-month-old, was shot in the neck, according to CNN affiliate KYW. All victims were taken to local hospitals and listed in stable condition, according to Philadelphia police. CNN's Sheena Jones contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Charleston shooting: Clementa Pinckney among victims - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Clementa Pinckney died doing work he had always felt was right for him to do. He was preaching when he and eight others were gunned down in South Carolina.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)They gathered at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church to study the Bible -- a small group, 13 people. Many were familiar faces. One was a stranger. But it was unfathomable that this stranger was a killer lying in wait, a man who would kill nine churchgoers and church leaders in cold blood. Police say Dylann Roof went to the church in Charleston, South Carolina, two hours from his home, and shot dead the pastor, other ministers and people who had come Wednesday to learn more about the Word of God. Here's what we know about the deceased:  The Rev. Clementa Pinckney died Wednesday doing the work he had always felt was right for him. He was spreading the Word when he and eight others were gunned down in the massacre. Pinckney, 41, answered the call to preach nearly 30 years ago, at the age of 13, according to a biography on the church website. He was a high achiever all his life. He was first appointed a pastor when he was 18. He graduated from Allen University magna cum laude and was president of the student body at the Columbia, South Carolina, school. Back then, Ebony magazine even featured him as one of its "Top College Students in America." In 1996, at 23, he was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives, the youngest black person ever to win such a seat. Four years later, voters elevated him to the state Senate. Pinckney became even more influential through his work as a legislator, pushing several causes -- like recently advocating for legislation to make police wear body cameras, believing it would protect lives, according to his cousin, state Sen. Kent Williams. Washington Post columnist David Broder called him a "political spirit lifter for surprisingly not becoming cynical about politics." U.S. Rep. Mark Sanford, a former governor of South Carolina, was among those who paid tribute Thursday. "He was a remarkable human being," Sanford told CNN's "New Day." "He had a gravelly, deep voice -- a radio announcer's voice, if you will -- and he approached life with that same level of gravitas." Williams called Pinckney "a man of character." "He was a God-fearing man. He was a family man." Williams added, "He had a passion for helping the poor, for helping to improve the quality of life for all mankind. But especially those who are the least among us." Pinckney left behind a wife, Jennifer, and two children, Eliana and Malana.  Like Pinckney, the Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr. was on the staff at Emanuel and regularly attended the Wednesday night Bible study sessions. The 74-year-old survived the initial shooting at the church, but he died during surgery. Earlier in his career, Simmons served at Greater Zion AME Church in Awendaw, just northeast of Charleston.  Cynthia Hurd loved God, her family, books and her community, her brother Malcolm Graham told CNN. He described her as the matriarch of the family and the glue that kept them together. She was baptized in the church and went there her whole life. Her late mother sang in the choir. So it was no surprise she would attend a weeknight Bible study. Hurd's loss is "incomprehensible" to the Charleston County Public Library, where she worked. In a statement, the library said she was much more than an employee. Hurd "dedicated her life to serving and improving the lives of others." All 16 branches of the library were closed Thursday in honor of Hurd, 54, who was manager of the St. Andrews Regional Library. That branch will be renamed in her honor. "We ask for prayers for her family, her co-workers, her church and this entire community as we come together to face this tragic loss," the library statement said. Hurd had worked for the library -- "helping residents, making sure they had every opportunity for an education and personal growth" -- for 31 years, the statement said. Her husband, Steve, was working as a longshoreman in Saudi Arabia, and the family is trying to get him home. Hurd also had four older brothers, including Graham, and a younger sister.  Sharonda Singleton was living what would appear to be a full and busy life. She was a speech therapist and track coach at Goose Creek High School about 20 miles north of Charleston, having been a track and field athlete when she attended South Carolina State University in Orangeburg. She was also a reverend at Emanuel AME Church, and she was a member of a sporting family. She was married to Christopher Singleton, who played football at Tennessee State University. And her son, Chris, who was born in 1995, plays baseball for Charleston Southern University. Before fighting off tears as he hugged his teammates, Chris Singleton described his mother as "a God-fearing woman (who) loved everybody with all her heart." "Love is always stronger than hate," he told reporters. "So if we just loved the way my mom would, then the hate won't be anywhere close to what it is."  Myra Thompson, 59, also died in the shooting, said Bishop Alphonza Gadsden, who was notified by the victim's family. Gadsden had known Thompson for a decade. "She was a person who loved the Lord. Her every objective was to please Him in all that she did. She was teaching Bible study when she was killed," she said  Tywanza Sanders' profile picture on Facebook is a selfie showing a young man with a winning smile and a sideways cap. Not only did he smile a lot, he made his friends happy. "If you met him, you knew you had a good friend on your side, regardless of anything," T.J. Grant told CNN. "He made you smile even when you didn't want to smile." His friend was very loving, especially of his family, Grant said. Sanders spoke of his mother often and went to see her all the time. The 26-year-old died trying to save his aunt, Susie Jackson, Grant and A.J. Harley said they were told. "It's just like Tywanza," Hartley, one of his best friends, told CNN. "He's always been there for everybody, especially to protect a family member. ... So it was good to hear ... that he didn't die in vain." Sanders was a quiet yet well-known student known for his warm and helpful spirit, according to a statement from Allen University, from which he graduated in 2014 from its Division of Business Administration. His friends have renamed a scholarship at their James Island high school in his honor because "that's what he was all about ... being educated, stimulating yourself, growing intellectually," Hartley said. Sanders' engagement in his community, and his sense of self, were also evident in his social media posts -- including some from just hours before the shooting. That includes a Facebook post, around 6 p.m. ET Wednesday, featured a video and the words, "Ever notice how the mainstream media treats black protesters &amp; white rioters differently?" That same day, he put up this quote from baseball groundbreaker Jackie Robinson: "A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives." This was a young man seemingly intent on going places. His cover photo on Facebook -- the banner photo that spreads behind the profile picture and tops the page -- featured only words in light letters set against a dark background. They said simply: "Your dreams are calling you."  The Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor was a school administrator, a passionate Christian and the mother of four daughters, according to friends and colleagues. The 49-year-old Middleton-Doctor started working in December as an admissions coordinator at the Charleston learning center of her alma mater, Southern Wesleyan University, a Christian college. "Always a warm and enthusiastic leader, DePayne truly believed in the mission of SWU to help students achieve their potential by connecting faith with learning," university President Todd Voss said. She received her Master's degree in management from the school in 1994 after doing her undergraduate work in biology and life sciences at Columbia College. She was an experienced grant writer and was a consultant for school districts before joining Southern Wesleyan, the school said. The Rev. George McKain, the national public affairs director for AME Zion Church who was in a bible study in North Charleston at the time of the shooting, recalled how Middleton-Doctor as an enthusiastic singer who had "a heart for missions, Christian education, loving all people (and) respective all generations." "She could just bring out the praises of God," McKain told CNN. "She a delight to know, a joy and a light in the midst of darkness."  Susie Jackson, 87, was a longtime member of the historic Charleston church, her grandson told CNN affiliate WEWS in Cleveland. Tim Jackson remembered his grandmother as a "very helpful person." She was a choir member and also was on the usher board of the church, where she had been a member for many years. Susie Jackson was a very loving, giving person with a great smile, her grandson told the station.  Even before her death, Ethel Lance's former co-workers missed her dearly. The 70-year-old had retired in 2002, but she left her mark at the Gaillard Auditorium. She ruled the auditorium's backstage for 34 years, said Cam Patterson, Charleston's director of special facilities. "Nobody dared try to move into her territory. That was her pride and joy," Patterson said. Lance was a wonderful employee and person, Patterson said. CNN's Justin Lear, Patrick Cornell and Christina Zdanowicz contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>The birth of a psychopath - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Instead of asking, "How could they do this horrible thing?" the more pertinent question might be, "When did he start doing horrible things?"</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)After every horrific crime that shocks us, the next question we often ask is, "How could anyone do such a thing?" If the criminal is a psychopath, the answer is very simple. They don't feel empathy or guilt. So instead of asking, "How could they do this horrible thing?" the more pertinent question might be, "When did they start doing horrible things?"  Psychopaths are pathological liars, manipulators, and charmers. They have a distinct lack of remorse for their own bad actions, a failure to accept responsibility for the same, and an overall lack of empathy. They are impulsive and irresponsible, seeking constant stimulation. Many are horribly violent and their motives "more commonly will involve sadistic gratification," according to an FBI bulletin devoted to the disorder. "The psychopath is an intraspecies predator," it reads. Psychopaths are found in every country, belong to every race, and the majority are men. According to several studies, roughly 1% of the men in the United States are probably psychopaths, and they most likely exhibited signs at a very young age. Those signs are key -- there is no known cure for full-blown psychopathy.  Researchers continue to search for a successful treatment plan, but "we don't have a therapy for it, and there's no known pill for psychopathy," said Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former FBI profiler who has written extensively about psychopaths. Any attempt at therapy has to be carefully structured and monitored, particularly in the case of a criminal psychopath, as they are equipped with the skill and motivation to act more as a predator than a patient. They can easily identify weaknesses in their therapists and feign progress to shorten treatment. Psychopaths don't seek out treatment on their own, said Robert Hare, who has studied psychopathy for more than 40 years and developed the scale used to measure it. He explained that psychopaths, not suffering any psychological or physical pain, don't believe there's anything about themselves that needs fixing. What kind of treatment might a psychopath even receive? "You can try to train them to feel emotions," said Hare, "but that is like trying to train a cat to be a mouse. None of the programs seem to work except those that change behavioral problems. You might get them to look out for themselves in a different way, to develop an enlightened self-interest." And in order to do that, early detection is paramount.  "If you look back in the childhood of any offender you can find a long, long history," said Hare, who authored "Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us." For the violent psychopath, an early sign might be cruelty to animals or complete lack of caring for other children, including teasing or even hurting them. It goes beyond the typical arguments at school or scuffles between siblings. "The behavior has to be well outside the norm," Hare said. While children are not labeled psychopaths, the markers that predict a high probability a child will develop a psychopathic personality include many of the same characteristics: lack of guilt; lack of empathy; lack of concern about performance; and shallow or insincere emotions. Over time, the behavior proves to be much more severe than typical childhood selfishness. Even compared with children with other behavior disorders or psychological issues, a child who has these traits and might be clinically labeled "callous-unemotional" will stand out to parents, teachers and peers. Identifying a psychopath, or a child at risk for developing psychopathy, relies on examining his or her behavior and interacting with the child over lengthy interviews based on the checklists and scales developed by Hare. There is no quick medical test that can give a definitive verdict on whether someone is a psychopath, or to what degree. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging scans have shown some functional differences in psychopaths' brains, particularly in the frontal cortex and limbic system. Psychopathy is also an inherited condition, according to J. Reid Meloy, forensic psychologist and author of "The Psychopathic Mind." "The more severe the psychopathy, the greater the inheritance for the disorder," he said. Hare agreed, adding, "There are genetic factors involved. There is enormous evidence indicating psychopathy is an interaction between genetics and the environment."  In the search for a treatment or management plan for psychopathy, "early intervention is really the only thing that's been shown to be effective," said Matt Logan, another leading researcher in the field and a former prison psychologist. Intensive, regular, long-term intervention from both parents and teachers is key. Programs may use cognitive behavioral therapy, group therapy, or other methods. Because children showing high levels of the callous-unemotional traits also typically have very low levels of fear and anxiety, they usually don't have a positive behavior change from programs emphasizing discipline. They are more likely to respond well to positive reinforcement and reward-oriented programs. Though there is some debate, many researchers believe it's important to recognize the children who need this specific, tailored help, even at the risk of a stigmatizing label like callous-unemotional, or later, psychopath. The goal, Hare said, "is to get these children to act more in line with what society expects." And as Hare points out, "Not all psychopaths are criminals. They are in business, government, academia and media. You'll find lots of these people, but they're not committing criminal acts. They will take advantage of people." Perhaps if potential psychopaths are given, at a very young age, the tools to get what they want within the laws and expectations of society, a greater number could live extraordinarily productive lives. Does being a psychopath make you more successful?  </corpo>

            <descricao>Debates over displaying the Confederate battle flag are as familiar here as grits and sweet tea. </descricao>
            <corpo>Columbia, South Carolina (CNN)Debates over displaying the Confederate battle flag are as familiar here as grits and sweet tea. But the outpouring of grief after a racist gunman killed nine African-Americans last week during a Bible study at a historic Charleston church is testing whether the longtime standoff can last. After imagery emerged over the weekend of confessed killer Dylann Roof embracing the flag, local activists and some elected officials are pressing for its removal from the Capitol grounds here. And with national attention focused on the state's fraught -- and often racially-tinged -- politics, they think they might finally win. "If we are going to do anything about it, it has to be now," said Boyd Brown, a former state representative who spoke at an anti-flag rally that attracted about 1,500 people this weekend. "You've got to keep this going. It's not just going to be hashtags."  The flag debate is quickly becoming a major political issue ahead of the state's crucial first-in-the-South presidential primary next year. Many Republicans, including Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, have avoided taking a position on the flag, though Jeb Bush highlighted his role in removing the flag from Florida's Capitol in 2001. Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton forcefully called on Americans to discuss racial divisions but hasn't weighed in specifically on whether South Carolina should remove the flag from the Capitol complex. READ: Republicans take a pass on Confederate flag Gov. Nikki Haley, who has said the issue is worth a conversation, is under pressure to convene a special session to take up the flag question. That's unlikely to happen but Republican state Rep. Doug Brannon has already committed to introducing a bill to remove the flag when the legislature convenes in January. That effort will face stiff headwinds. As part of a compromise in 2000, lawmakers agreed to remove the Confederate flag from the top of the Capitol dome and place it across the street while also adding a monument to African-Americans. But the legislation mandated that only a supermajority of the legislature could change that set-up going forward. Privately, state lawmakers doubt Brannon's ability to attract enough Republicans to his side because he's not a member of the leadership. Brannon said that he has talked to two dozen Republicans in the lower chamber and they reacted positively, with some offering to sign on as co-sponsors. But he admitted that he hasn't thought much about how to piece together two-thirds of both houses to pass the bill. "Right now my strategy is to scream a lot because my friend is dead," Brannon told CNN, referring to state Sen. Clementa Pickney, the pastor of the Charleston church who was among those killed. "Sen. Pickney's death and the death of eight others, that has to move us to do the right thing." In an interview Sunday with CNN's Poppy Harlow, Brannon said he has long believed the flag should be in a museum. When asked why he hasn't done anything on the issue until now, he responded "I didn't do my job."  But what will matter more in the renewed flag fight is not the raw and complex emotions in the wake of the killings, but something much more simple--math. "I appreciate the rally, but it has no impact on the legislative process," said state Sen. Darryl Jackson, a Democrat who helped hammer out the 2000 compromise. "The politics of the flag are the politics of the primary voter." READ: In Charleston's wake, Clinton speaks forcefully on guns, race From his church pulpit on Sunday, Jackson urged patience on the flag issue, saying later that it could be interpreted as disrespectful to the dead to turn so quickly to politics. "People are saying let's get some action now, but I don't want to alienate people I will need for a compromise," he said. "If we don't get a bi-partisan concensus, we will be fighting for the next 100 years." There is a framework for such efforts. South Carolina lawmakers forged a bipartisan agreement this year on body camera legislation after the shooting death of Walter Scott by a white police office. "This will not be done in a knee-jerk fashion," said Marlon Kimpson, a Democratic state representative. "I'm going to be in focus groups with business leaders and talking to constituents. The massacre opened up an opportunity but to build a super majority will require a lot of work." The politics of the flag are complicated in South Carolina. A November poll from Winthrop University found that 73% of whites in the state want the flag to remain where it is. The same poll reported that 61% of blacks want it taken down. "If we look at what the Confederate flag meant in the past, you can't help but feel negative thoughts, especially now," said 24-year-old Meghan Delaney. "It should have been taken down a long time ago. If not now, when?" For some whites, many of whom can trace their ancestry back to the Civil War, the flag represents heritage and pride. "It's a symbol of family and my ancestors who defended the state from invasion. It was about standing up to a central government," said Chris Sullivan, who is a member of the Sons of the Confederacy. "The things that our ancestors fought for were not novel and they really are the same issues we have today." But on the Capitol grounds just a few hundred feet from the Confederate flag, activists over the weekend vowed to reclaim "southern pride" as inclusive and emblematic of a new, more diverse region where the "stars and bars" have no place. VIDEO: Watch Obama react to mass U.S. shootings "This heritage is hate," read one sign. "Yep, it's racist," read another.  While there has yet to be a visible push-back from proponents of the flag, they are quietly reaching out to lawmakers. One worry among proponents is that taking down the flag would open up other monuments to scrutiny. The flag is just one of several monuments that includes a statue of one-time segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond and Ben Tillman, who sought to disenfranchise black citizens while he was governor. A stone marks the site of the state house before Sherman's troops burned it the ground during the Civil War. "What's the difference between the flag and the monument," Sullivan asked. "That's what people are upset about now, but what about later?"  </corpo>

            <descricao>Florida beaches are blooming with a potentially deadly species of bacterium but that doesn't mean you are at risk of being infected if you go.</descricao>
            <corpo>Take caution if you're headed to the Florida beaches this summer: a potentially deadly species of bacteria found in saltwater has infected at least eight people and killed two people so far this year, according to state officials. The bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus, blooms in Florida's warm May to October climate. ABC News reported that there were 32 recorded cases of infection in that state last year, and seven deaths. Related: Beat 16 summer health hazards The good news: Most of us are at a low risk of death, or even harm, from the bug, which some people are calling "flesh-eating" but is rarely that dangerous to watergoers, unless you have an underlying immune problem, like liver disease, and/or an open cut or wound. In that case, coming into contact Vibrio vulnificus could lead to inflammation, ulcers, and, if the infection worsens, amputation and even death. Even if you're not immunocomprised, note that the bacterium does proliferate in raw shellfish caught in Florida‚Äîparticularly in oysters, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)‚Äîso "if you don't cook your shellfish properly, you're setting yourself up for trouble," says Aileen Marty, MD, professor of infectious diseases at Florida International University. Think gastrointestinal issues like vomiting and stomach pain at best, and at worst, septicemia, a.k.a an infection the blood. Related: 14 most dangerous summer foods Again, Dr. Marty stresses, most people have nothing to fear from wandering into the Florida waters this summer. But if you think you may have been infected, head to your doctor ASAP for antibiotics, and to make sure you're protected, follow these tips from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health: ‚Ä¢Do not eat raw oysters or other raw shellfish. ‚Ä¢Wear protective clothing (e.g., gloves) when handling raw shellfish. ‚Ä¢Cook shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels) thoroughly. ‚Ä¢Eat shellfish promptly after cooking and refrigerate leftovers. ‚Ä¢Avoid exposure of open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, or to raw shellfish harvested from such waters. ‚Ä¢Individuals who are immunocompromised should wear proper foot protection to prevent cuts and injury caused by rocks and shells on the beach.

            <cabecalho>America's homeless doctor brings health care to streets - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Dr. Jim Withers has created a global "street medicine" movement to bring medical care to the homeless.</descricao>
            <corpo>Pittsburgh (CNN)Dr. Jim Withers used to dress like a homeless person. On purpose. Two to three nights a week, he rubbed dirt in his hair and muddied up his jeans and shirt before walking the dark streets of Pittsburgh, searching for the very people he was trying to emulate. Withers wanted to connect with those who had been excluded from his care. "I was actually really shocked how ill people were on the street. It was like going to a third-world country," he said. "Young, old, people with mental illness, runaway kids, women (who) fled domestic violence, veterans. And they all have their own story." Homelessness costs the medical system a lot of money. Individuals often end up in emergency rooms, and stay there longer, because their illnesses go untreated and can lead to complications. For 23 years, Withers has been treating the homeless -- under bridges, in alleys and along riverbanks. "We realized that this was something that could be addressed. We could make 'house calls,' " he said. It's something that Withers' father, a rural doctor, often did. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 Withers' one-man mission became a citywide program called Operation Safety Net. Since 1992, the group has reached more than 10,000 individuals and helped more than 1,200 of them transition into housing. In addition to street rounds, the program has a mobile van, drop-in centers and a primary health clinic, all where the homeless can access medical care. Today, Withers is also fostering a global "street medicine" movement. His nonprofit, the Street Medicine Institute, supports communities in starting programs of their own. Its network includes dozens of teams in the United States and around the world. I recently talked with Withers about his work and his ultimate vision. Below is an edited version of our conversation: CNN: How does it work, doing rounds in homeless camps? Dr. Jim Withers: It can be a challenge to keep up with where the camps are. The homeless are often evicted. Their belongings are taken. And so they have to keep moving. And therefore we have to keep moving to keep up to date on their camps. Doing walking rounds, we try to keep our team down to four people. We don't want to invade (their space) with a lot of people. It's their home. So there's an outreach expert who knows the field and knows the people. There's myself or a medical person, and then we always have a student or two. And we bring a social worker with us. We'll go into the camp, and we make sure they're OK with us coming in. Almost all the homeless are cordial, if not downright really friendly. And we just join them, and they can express what's going on. We always try then to check in with how they're doing medically. If they have insurance, if they have medicines that they should be on that they ran out of. Do they have a doctor? "Did you get that looked at?" What's important to the patient, the person, is our priority. The care that we deliver out there is dependent on what's in our backpacks. We try to emphasize that this is not good enough. Getting (them) into primary care is our goal. READ: Dr. Withers in his own words CNN: What ailments do you see out there? Withers: People on the street, they're exposed to the elements obviously. So you see a lot of things that have to do with the weather and the difficulties of sleeping out there: frostbite, dehydration, hypothermia. But they also have everyday things, like high blood pressure, diabetes, coughs and colds, pneumonia, injuries. We've seen people with cancers. We've seen liver failure, people who needed dialysis that we actually took to dialysis from the street. It goes on and on and on. We've seen almost everything that I've seen clinically and a few things that I hadn't. So it's a very rich environment for medical teaching, unfortunately. CNN: You consider the streets to be a kind of classroom for students. What is their experience? Withers: I see it in the eyes of the students that I take out. They see how many people are living in places that you'd never want to live. The weather, the rain, the cold. I think they also get the chance to see success. When they can see a street person succeed and not just get locked in that hopeless category, their vision changes. The street classroom really ignites, or reignites, what their passion is. They feel like, "Yes, this is what it's about." And they carry that forward. I think the lessons the homeless can teach us about finding the humanity and listening to people are transcendent in all of health care. Our students, I like to think of them as viruses. And we're spreading them out and they're beginning to go to their medical residencies, and they're saying, "Do you have street medicine here?" or "Why aren't you going under bridges?" And so the dialogue is really spreading. CNN: What's your hope for the future? Withers: In the way I'd like to see things, every person who is still on the streets will have medical care that comes directly to them and says, "You matter." And I'd love to see every medical school have a classroom of the streets. I've dedicated myself as much as I can to finding anyone, anywhere, who's interested in doing medical care to their own street people and helping them. Besides just the good that it does and the money that it saves, having street medicine in every community transforms us. We begin to see that we're all in this together. It's something that we should take pride in when we can actually treat people the way we would want to be treated. Want to get involved? Check out Operation Safety Net and the Street Medicine Institute to learn how you can help.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>6 new theme park rides that are worth the trip - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>U.S. theme parks are trying to lure you in by creating rides that try to do what no other ride can. Six new rides are totally worth the trip.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)They're described as "giga," "free-fly" and "wing" coasters, and they boast of being the "tallest," "fastest," you name it. All you really need to know is that more and more theme parks in the United States are trying to lure you in by creating rides that try to do what no other ride can. There are at least 16 new roller coasters across the country that have opened or are about to open this spring and summer, according to ultimaterollercoaster.com. Here are six of them that are totally worth the trip:  This ride, which opened in March, is named for the height it reaches: 325 feet, making it the tallest of the so-called giga coasters, which reach between 300 and 399 feet tall. Riders will race down the coaster's twisted 6,602-foot-long track at speeds of 95 mph, at one point passing through a "91-degree overbanked horseshoe turn." Joel Bullock, who reviews rides on coastercritic.com, said riders are momentarily lifted out of their seats several times during the ride, and then pinned down by the G-force. Be prepared for a narrow tunnel and a close fly-by with a support beam. Where it is: Carowinds; on South Carolina-North Carolina line near Charlotte. Why it's cool: This gravity-defying coaster will have you wanting to ride it again and again.  With legs dangling below the seat, riders on "Batman" are flipped head-over-heels on this 4D free-fly coaster. Six Flags says that you'll "fly like Batman" on this "wing" coaster, which has riders sit on either side of the roller coaster tracks with nothing above or below. If you're a fan of the DC Comics superhero, this ride promises to immerse you in the Batman storyline through its 4D special effects. Thrill-seekers will also be rewarded with at least four head-over-heels free-fly flips, a steep climb up a 120-foot hill, and two "beyond 90-degree raven drops." Where it is: Six Flags Fiesta Texas; San Antonio, Texas. Why it's cool: It's in 4D, it's different every time you ride it, and it has two complete vertical free falls.  Southern California recently got its first water roller coaster when the 1,000-foot-long Aqua Rocket opened this summer. Riders get into a four-person raft that's magnetically pushed down and around the coaster track, including four peaks and three "continuous rocket incline zones" going as fast as 30 mph. Despite some chilly water temperatures, reviewer Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times wrote "the zip-zip-zip uphill portions were probably the funnest part of the water coaster, in part because most water slides are a downhill-only experience." Where it is: Raging Waters Park; near Los Angeles. Why it's cool: Conveyer-belt lift instead of stairs, magnetic technology allows for cool uphill experience and you get to stay cool on a hot summer day.  This new ride combines interactivity with the thrills of a roller coaster: riders team up with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and other superheroes to destroy The Joker and Lex Luthor with interactive laser blasters, and experience the first virtual loop on a dark ride. Where it is: Six Flags Over Texas near Dallas and Six Flags St. Louis. Why it's cool: It's a 4D interactive dark ride, each rider has his or her own blaster gun to fend off bad guys, and it appeals to fans of the DC Comics superheroes.  It's the world's first waterslide gaming experience, and it's called Slideboarding. As riders go down the waterslide, they try to hit targets for points by pressing colored buttons on the slide board. After the ride, they can see how they stacked up to others and try to improve their score on the next ride. You even get to pick the music that plays during your trip. Where it is: Wet N' Wild; Las Vegas. Why it's cool: Perfect for gamers and riders looking to compete with others.  This steel roller coaster has loops, rolls, "near-misses" with trees and buildings, and it'll propel you from 0-to-60 miles per hour in less than four seconds. Holiday World says the Thunderbird has the tallest vertical loop of any other wing coaster. The track spans over 3,000 feet and is 140-feet tall at its peak.

            <corpo>(CNN)A festival goer died at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, a massive extravaganza of electronic dance music drawing hundreds of thousands of revelers. The circumstances of the man's death Saturday are not yet clear. The Clark County coroner's office has not released the man's name or cause of death, CNN affiliate KTNV said. It's also not clear if the weather played a role. The temperature Saturday in Las Vegas soared to 113 degrees Fahrenheit -- tying the city's record high temperature. Insomniac, the company producing the three-day festival, issued a statement after the death. "We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the man who passed away. The health and safety of our fans is Insomniac's first priority and we take every measure to create a safe environment," Insomniac said. "While the cause of this tragedy will take some time to determine, we ask that you keep his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers." More than 400 medical calls have been reported from the festival, which ends Monday, KTNV said. Seven people were taken to a hospital. About 135,000 people attended the second night of Electric Daisy Carnival on Saturday.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Inside church massacre: A mom 'laid in her son's blood' - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Relatives of victims describe in horrifying detail how the shooting in Charleston unfolded. A mom "watched her son fall. She laid there in his blood."</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)When Dylann Roof walked into the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, he immediately asked for the pastor. He was greeted by the deep baritone of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, known simply as Clem by his friends and congregation. A man so steeped in faith, Pinckney was called into the ministry in his teens. He served as pastor for the last 23 years and a South Carolina legislator for 19. It wasn't unusual for a stranger to stroll into the church. Summertime brings tourists by the thousands to historic downtown Charleston. Many stop in to catch a glimpse of history inside the oldest black church in the South. The church is known as "Mother Emanuel" in Charleston. As the nation grappled with the carnage of Wednesday's massacre, relatives of victims -- as well as church members who spoke with survivors -- told CNN how the shooting unfolded: Pinckney brought Roof into his Bible study shortly after 8 p.m. "Being the nice, kind welcoming person he is, Clementa welcomed him to his congregation," said Sylvia Johnson, a cousin of the pastor. Wednesdays at the church are a time of thoughtful reflection and a time to catch up with friends. Casserole dishes are served up with smiles at Wednesday night supper before talk turns to God. If Roof had arrived earlier, the church would've been packed. Dozens of people had attended a church session in the hour before. That's around when Tywanza Sanders, 26, posted a quote from Jackie Robinson on his Instagram account: "A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives." Sanders was at the Bible study with his pastor and about a dozen others, including Sanders' mother and his great aunt, 87-year-old Susie Jackson. The family matriarch, Jackson loved everything about the church, living just a few blocks away and singing in its choir for decades. Roof took up a seat next to Pinckney. He sat there for about an hour. They prayed together. They talked about Scripture. The group could never have known what was in his mind. The scowl on his face in his Facebook profile photo. His dark eyes snarling, above patches on his jacket of the South African and Rhodesian flags representing white supremacy. The worshipers couldn't have known his plan. He was there to start a race war. He was there with the intent to kill them. Because they were black. What words congregants may have been exchanged with their visitor during the Bible study remains unknown. But it is clear he was surrounded by love. Church shooting strikes at the heart of black culture And that's why what happened next is so haunting. So disturbing. That he could spend time to meet his victims -- and still carry through with his plan to commit mass murder. According to CNN-affiliate WBRC, Roof had second thoughts but decided to go through with the massacre because no one else was going to do it. "After joining them for some period of time, he obviously became very aggressive and violent," Johnson said. He pulled out his handgun -- .45-caliber shell casings were later found at the scene -- that had been hidden behind a fanny pack around his waist, and he opened fire. It is believed he shot Pinckney first. Tywanza Sanders leapt up, concerned about the pastor. He pleaded with Roof. Said he didn't have to do this. Tried to talk him down. Snapchat of Bible study Roof disagreed. "No, you've raped our women and you are taking over the country. I have to do what I have to do," he said, according to Johnson, who was quoting a survivor. He then pointed his gun at the oldest person in the room, Susie Jackson. Sanders tried to shield his great aunt from the volley of bullets. Both were killed. "He was trying to protect his aunt. That's him 100%," family friend A.J. Harley said. Sanders' mother, Felecia, pretended to be dead. "She watched her son fall," Johnson said. "She laid there in his blood." Survivors have told friends Roof reloaded his gun at least five times. He told one woman that he would spare her so she could tell the world what happened and that he planned to kill himself. When the shooting was done, nine were dead -- one of the worst acts of domestic terrorism since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Each victim was shot multiple times. Before Roof left the church, he stood over one of the victims and "uttered a racially inflammatory statement," according to his arrest warrant. "It is devastating that somebody would go into God's house and commit such a crime," said Kent Williams, a cousin of the pastor. At 26, Tywanza Sanders was the youngest victim. His great aunt was the oldest. Pinckney, a father of two girls and stalwart of the black community, was 41. "He had this deep voice that everybody wished they had. When he spoke, he commanded your attention. He always had words of wisdom," Williams said. "We're just gonna miss him." The other six victims were:  The bloodshed has shaken Charleston -- and the nation. In the words of Williams: "It says to the world that we're not safe anywhere anymore. ... It is despicable." The 21-year-old Roof appeared before a judge Friday through a remote video feed, showing no emotion in a striped prison jumpsuit. He is charged with nine counts of murder. If his plan was to start a race war, Roof was met by an amazing level of forgiveness. "You hurt a lot of people but God forgives you, and I forgive you," a daughter of Ethel Lance said. Felecia Sanders -- the mother who saw her son die Wednesday night -- recalled how she and the others welcomed Roof into the Bible study. "We enjoyed you," she told the court. "But may God have mercy on you." Who were the victims?  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Inequality can be dismantled at the root (Opinion)  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Around the world today, the greatest threat to justice is inequality.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Darren Walker is president of the Ford Foundation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Around the world today, the greatest threat to justice is inequality. Inequality is the byproduct of systems and structures -- intentional policies and ingrained prejudices -- that have over many decades tilted the scales in favor of some, while limiting opportunity for many others. Here's what we can do: Attack inequality at its roots. Thanks to the roadmap outlined in Thomas Piketty's bestseller "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" or Joseph Stiglitz's recent report on the importance of shared prosperity, we can identify the origins of inequality. At the Ford Foundation, we have long sought to address the root causes of injustice. As we survey the state of justice, we see inequality as the biggest barrier to human dignity and economic opportunity. We have affirmed that inequality extends far beyond the wealth gap. Inequality is political, social, and cultural in nature. It contributes to deficits in democracy and discrimination along racial, ethnic and gender lines. It is reflected in rising extremism, acute poverty, and even in the consequences of climate change. While inequality varies by region, the underlying forces that increase inequality are remarkably constant. From Jakarta to Cairo, Rio de Janeiro to New York City, we found five consistent factors that contribute to inequality. First is the pervasiveness of short-term thinking in markets. Market mechanisms that focus on profits in the short-term have huge long-term costs for our environment, health, and the potential for shared prosperity. Second, we found that political institutions dominated by elite interests are significant drivers of inequality. In nearly every country, a small number of individuals and groups wield disproportionate power to shape public policies, while most people have far more limited access to influence. This imbalance undermines the promise of democracy and leads to a breakdown in social cohesion as people grow distrustful of government. These first two factors contribute to a third: Broken social contracts. Today, a weak set of rights and responsibilities guides the relationships between workers and businesses, citizens and governments. The social fabric of our communities has been hollowed out by the lack of investment in public goods, public infrastructure, and the auctioning off of key natural resources for private benefit. This crumbling of the social contract means less upward mobility across the civic landscape. Fourth, there's discrimination. Women, indigenous people, LGBT, the poor, and racial and ethnic minorities lack equal status and full rights. This discrimination is embedded in our cultures and institutions, and it perpetuates biased policies. And finally, we see dominant cultural narratives that undermine fairness, tolerance and inclusion. These narratives reinforce stereotypes in society, and play out in media coverage that stokes fear without understanding, or in school textbooks that gloss over some of the difficult truths of history. Combatting narratives of intolerance requires powerful counternarratives that embrace -- and truly celebrate -- diversity and inclusion. By identifying what we see as inequality's five drivers, we encourage those working on any one of these issues to look more holistically, more systemically and more deeply at the solving the problem. We cannot focus solely on the economic piece of the puzzle, or look at racial or educational inequality in isolation. Doing so treats symptoms while ignoring the disease. We believe in the possibilities of this holistic approach to embrace it within our organization. The Ford Foundation is re-organizing itself so that every issue that we work on will be interconnected. We will look for solutions to dismantle these drivers of inequality which reinforce each other in pernicious ways by putting people at the center and addressing causes at the structural level. Our efforts going forward will also support other institutions, individuals and ideas seeking to disrupt these interconnected drivers of inequality. The stakes are high because we understand inequality to be global, pervasive, growing, and a central threat to social justice and human dignity. Ultimately, it will take all of us, working together, across boundaries of geography, expertise, differences, and belief, to uproot inequality and plant a new tree that can grow into justice, once and for all.

            <descricao>In Keyana Tahmaseb's surrealist photo series "Human Canvas," people appear to fade into their surroundings.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Our surroundings in domestic life and daily routines can comfort us, providing stability and consistency amid the chaos of our busy lives. However, surroundings can also trap us, become mundane and make us feel awash in sameness. Keyana Tahmaseb explores the idea of feeling trapped and fading into one's surroundings in her surrealist photo series "Human Canvas." In this series, the subjects literally blend with settings and objects through paint and other materials. Tahmaseb initially took inspiration from Irving Penn's 1949 photo "Girl in Bed," which depicts a woman lying facedown on a bed wearing a night gown that matches the sheets. "I wanted to play with this idea of invisibility and blending in," she said. For her first photo in the series -- No. 3 in the gallery above -- Tahmaseb painted a woman's back to match a rose-printed bedsheet. Tahmaseb said this image was completely inspired by Penn, and from there she let the concept grow, moving to wallpapers, objects and even a lumber mill. The photos hide the subjects' faces, either by looking away from the viewer or being covered. "I feel like without a face, it's more relatable," Tahmaseb said. "You can't exactly tell how old they are or what they look like." Her idea was to enhance the feeling of invisibility, "which is something that's relatable to everyone." Though Tahmaseb's series is not completely free from Photoshop retouching, most of each image was created without digital manipulation. Each photo took between two to six hours to set up and shoot. She wanted to be completely hands-on with this series, including putting together props and sets. She also painted the subjects herself. Tahmaseb describes herself growing up with a paintbrush in one hand and a drawing pencil in the other, spending much of her grade school and college years in art classes. In "Human Canvas," she combines her multimedia background as a photographer and a painter. "I love being able to do all these different things within one project," Tahmaseb said. "I hate saying I'm a photographer sometimes, because I feel like I'm more than that. Painting on people, they become my sculptures." She began this project while studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York. After she began the series by painting her subjects, her classmates challenged her to try using other materials to turn her models into chameleons. This included covering herself with birthday cake in a self-portrait and covering one subject in mud at a lumber mill. With the busyness of patterns and textures in the photos, Tahmaseb keeps things simple stylistically. She uses natural lighting as much as possible, occasionally relying on studio lights if the photo calls for more drama. She also keeps the frame free of anything besides the subjects and their settings. "I wanted you to see most of the body, and I wanted to leave some negative space so that it's not too much with the patterns," she said. "I like my images to look pretty clean and not too suffocating." "Human Canvas" is a window into something that can be felt, but not always explained -- an examination of this trapped feeling through dreamlike images. "I'm creating these little worlds, these little sets. In a way these images are theatrical, even cinematic," Tahmaseb described. "They are a frozen moment in time of the surreal and psychological from this little world." Tahmaseb said that she plans to continue the series, pushing it in new directions through different materials and surroundings. Keyana Tahmaseb is a photographer based in New York.

            <cabecalho>New York prison break: DNA found in cabin - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>DNA from New York prison escapees Richard Matt and David Sweat was found on items inside a cabin in rural Franklin County, New York, source told CNN.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)DNA from New York prison escapees Richard Matt and David Sweat has been found inside a burglarized cabin in upstate New York, a law enforcement source told CNN. The discovery has re-energized the two-week-old search for the convicted killers, who staged an escape from Clinton Correctional Facility on June 6 worthy of a movie script and haven't been seen since -- at least not by authorities. However, a witness on Saturday spotted someone running into the woods near a cabin in the Mountain View community, only 25 to 30 miles from the prison, according to acting Franklin County District Attorney Glenn MacNeill. Investigators think the figure spotted Saturday could have been one of the fugitive prisoners, MacNeill said. Since then, law enforcement authorities have flooded the rugged terrain of Franklin County, swooping in on helicopters, cruisers and all-terrain vehicles to scour the region for the men. Briefing reporters Monday, New York State Police Maj. Charles Guess declined to get into specifics about what was found at the cabin for fear of jeopardizing the search. "It's a confirmed lead for us," he said. "It has generated a massive law enforcement response, as you can see, and we're going to run this to ground." The break-in suggests the men "need provisions and are desperate," a law enforcement source briefed on the investigation told CNN's Deborah Feyerick. The huge manhunt for Matt, 48, and Sweat, 35, is now in its 18th day. There's no evidence the fugitives have the kind of support network they would need to get far away from the maximum security facility after their plan to get a ride from prison tailor Joyce Mitchell fell apart, the source said.  Searchers are having to contend with difficult conditions in the area, which is surrounded by dense forest and near a winter ski resort. "Even in the area where we think they were last seen, it's very rough terrain," said Sheriff Kevin Mulverhill in Owls Head, Franklin County. "It's not easy to get to, it's not easy to traverse." Police are now working to contain the two men in the area, based on the understanding that they are running and on foot, the source said. Officers at a series of road blocks in Franklin County were checking cars Monday, asking drivers to pop their trunks. Nearer to the cabin at the center of the search, the law enforcement presence grew heavier. Authorities are concerned that Matt, 48, and Sweat, 35, may be monitoring radio communications, the source said, without being specific on whether the men have radios or similar devices giving them the ability to monitor police communications.  The sighting and DNA discovery explain the sudden influx of law enforcement teams into Franklin County. For much of the weekend, attention had been focused on an area near New York's border with Pennsylvania, some 260 miles to the southwest of the prison, after somebody reported a possible sighting of the two fugitives. That search wrapped up late Sunday, New York State Police said. MacNeill urged residents of Franklin County to be alert for potential danger during the search for the escaped killers, whom authorities described last week as posing a "significant threat to anyone who may come into contact with them." "Be inside with the doors locked and very diligent," MacNeill warned residents. Some residents left the area, but others chose to stay put. Shannon Hart said he visited cabins he takes care of on Monday not far from the one where the escapees are thought to have been. He told CNN that he wasn't concerned when he went out there because he was armed.  Matt and Sweat cut holes through steel cell walls, then shimmied along catwalks and through pipes before emerging from a manhole outside the prison gates and disappearing. The tools they used may have been smuggled inside a frozen chunk of hamburger meat, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN on Monday. Investigators are looking into whether Mitchell convinced a prison guard to pass the meat to the inmates in a way that bypassed a metal detector, the source said. The two escapees were housed in an honor block where they were allowed to cook their own food. Their escape set off a massive search for them and an investigation of employees and practices at the prison. Mitchell has been charged with aiding the escapees, and a corrections officer has been placed on paid leave, authorities have said. Accused of helping the fugitives by supplying tools like chisels and drill bits, Mitchell is in jail and has pleaded not guilty to the charges against her.  The corrections officer placed on leave is Gene Palmer, a 28-year veteran of Clinton Correctional Facility who is cooperating fully with the investigation, his attorney Andrew Brockway told CNN. Palmer knew Matt and Sweat for years at the prison and had received a painting done by Matt, Brockway said. But he wasn't aware the inmates were planning an escape, the attorney stressed. Palmer used Matt and Sweat as "sources" for information that he would "use to ensure the safety of his coworkers and of the facility, and of other inmates," Brockway told CNN. "He wants these two individuals to be caught, and anything that he can do to help law enforcement do their job, he's willing to cooperate," Brockway said Monday. Opinion: What will happen to the prison tailor? CNN's Gary Tuchman, Jason Carroll, Sara Ganim, Linh Tran, Alexandra Field, Carolyn Sung, David Shortell, Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez and Poppy Harlow contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year. "There is no stronger bond between man and dog than that formed during war," Farthing said at the annual tribute show, which aired Sunday night on CNN's global networks. The star-studded event, held in New York at the American Museum of Natural History, honored the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2014 -- everyday people making extraordinary efforts to change the world. Of those 10, CNN's audience voted Farthing as the Hero of the Year. "Wow, I am absolutely at a loss for words," Farthing said as he accepted the award. "This is absolutely amazing. I would really like to thank everybody who voted for the Nowzad charity and what we do in Afghanistan and believing in us. And I would also like to thank all the other heroes in this room for doing what they do to make this world an absolute better place. Thank you guys for doing what you do. Thank you." In addition to the $25,000 that each person receives for making the Top 10, Farthing will be awarded $100,000 for his cause. The inspiration for Nowzad Dogs came in 2006. When Farthing helped break up a dogfight in the town of Nowzad, Afghanistan, the Royal Marine sergeant didn't think much of it. The war-torn town was overrun with dogs. But when one of those dogs followed him back to base, it was hard to tell who rescued whom. "As the troop sergeant, I was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job. ... But no one was doing that for me," Farthing said earlier this year. "My time with this dog was a way of de-stressing, collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game." After his tour ended, Farthing went through a difficult process to get Nowzad home to Britain. Realizing he wasn't the only one, he soon founded Nowzad Dogs to help other soldiers whose lives were turned around by the animals they befriended. Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in Afghanistan. The group's shelter and clinic in Kabul are staffed by 14 Afghan nationals, four of whom are trained veterinarians. The group spays and neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population. In turn, those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets. To date, Nowzad Dogs has reunited nearly 700 soldiers with the animals they adopted in Afghanistan. "I know that the dog I looked after was my saving grace from the stress of conflict," Farthing said. "And because of that initial bond, the work goes on: reuniting soldiers with their companions, tackling rabies and training veterinarians in Kabul. I would like to thank everybody for their support. We're making a difference for the Afghan people, the soldiers and one dog and cat at a time." Celebrity presenters at the tribute show this year included actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Christina Hendricks, Taye Diggs, Rosie Perez, Uzo Aduba and John Leguizamo. Also appearing were comedian Kathy Griffin, musician Questlove of The Roots, Kelly Ripa of "Live with Kelly and Michael" and Morgan Spurlock of CNN's "Inside Man." The event included musical performances by Sheryl Crow and Trisha Yearwood. Yearwood performed her latest song, "PrizeFighter," while Crow performed "Wide River to Cross" with CNN Hero Arthur Bloom and his MusiCorps Wounded Warrior Band. Musician Nick Jonas, actor Tyler James Williams and actress Quvenzhane Wallis were also on hand to present awards to remarkable "young wonders" who are doing their part to help change their communities. The stories of this year's Top 10 Heroes, who were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN, can be found at CNNHeroes.com. Through Amazon Payments, anyone who wants to contribute can make a direct charitable donation to a Hero's designated nonprofit until December 31. Since 2007, the CNN Heroes campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com. It has also received more than 50,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. As part of their award package, each of the Top 10 CNN Heroes will also receive organizational training through the Annenberg Foundation, a global supporter of nonprofit organizations. All 10 Heroes will participate in customized versions of the Annenberg Alchemy program, tailored to help grow their individual organizations.  Arthur Bloom Arthur Bloom has used the healing power of music to help hundreds of injured soldiers recover their lives. His program, MusiCorps, pairs professional musicians with troops recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, helping them play instruments and write and record music. "By injecting music into this space, we can inject life," Bloom said. "There's nothing injured about the way they do it. It's just good music."

Since 2006, his nonprofit, Lionsraw, has engaged more than 500 volunteers in construction projects and educational programs that have benefited nearly 6,000 children. "We're trying to harness the passion of football fans to make a difference," he said.

            <descricao>Barack Obama used the n-word to make a point about racism in America during an interview podcast with comedian Marc Maron on "WTF with Marc Maron" out Monday.</descricao>
            <corpo>This article contains language that some may find offensive. Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama used the n-word during an interview released Monday to make a point that there's still plenty of room for America to combat racism. "Racism, we are not cured of it. And it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public," Obama said in an interview for the podcast "WTF with Marc Maron." "That's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It's not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don't, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior." The jarring comment comes as the nation is engaged in a debate over the role of race after a white supremacist killed nine African-Americans last week in a historically black church in Charleston. They also reflect a growing willingness for Obama to discuss race during the final years of his presidency. READ: Inside the battle over the Confederate flag Obama said there has been progress on race relations over the decades, citing his own experience as a young man who was born to a white mother and an African father. "I always tell young people, in particular, do not say that nothing has changed when it comes to race in America, unless you've lived through being a black man in the 1950s or '60s or '70s. It is incontrovertible that race relations have improved significantly during my lifetime and yours," Obama said. But he added that "the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination" exists in institutions and casts "a long shadow and that's still part of our DNA that's passed on." The White House released a statement saying that this is not the first time the President has used the N-word. "Truth is he uses the term about a dozen times in Dreams from my Father," White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said. READ: Republicans take a pass on Confederate flag Obama echoed comments in the immediate aftermath of last week's shooting, saying he's had to make speeches about a "devastating loss" too often. "It's not enough just to feel bad. There are actions that could be taken to make events like this less likely. One of those actions we could take would be to enhance some basic common sense gun safety laws," Obama said. Obama lamented Congress's lack of action on gun control and said "Unfortunately, the grip of the NRA on Congress is extremely strong. I don't foresee any legislative action being taken in this Congress." Obama also weighed in on a critical case that is currently before the Supreme Court, where opponents of the Affordable Care Act are asking whether the law authorizes tax subsidies for 6.4 million Americans who have already received help to afford health coverage. READ: How the Supreme Court could send Obamacare into a "death spiral" "First of all I'm confident we'll win, because the law is clearly on our side," Obama said. He added that if the nation's highest court were to rule in favor of the ACA's opponents, "five to six million people could lose their healthcare."

            <descricao>Charles "Chase" Merritt, the man accused of killing four members of the McStay family in 2010, will stand trial, a California judge rules.</descricao>
            <corpo>San Bernardino, California (CNN)The man accused of killing four members of the McStay family in 2010 will stand trial, a California judge ruled Monday. Judge Michael A. Smith determined there was sufficient evidence to try Charles "Chase" Merritt on four counts of murder for the bludgeoning deaths of Joseph and Summer McStay and their two young boys. Merritt has pleaded not guilty. He was a former business partner of Joseph McStay, who sold outdoor water displays over the Internet. The 2010 disappearance of the McStays has been one of Southern California's most enduring mysteries. Heartbreaking details of how the family died emerged at Monday's preliminary hearing for Merritt, who was arrested late last year. Desert deaths mystery: Five questions about the McStay case One after another, half a dozen detectives and FBI agents took the witness stand in San Bernardino Superior Court to provide the details of the family's violent end. They told how the McStays -- Joseph, Summer and their sons Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3 -- were bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer and buried in shallow graves in the high desert outside Victorville, northeast of Los Angeles. For a time after their disappearance, the McStays were believed to have taken off on an extended vacation to Mexico. But the details didn't add up: Eggs were left on a kitchen counter and the house was being renovated. The family dogs were left, tethered and unfed, in the backyard. And then in November 2013, their skeletal remains were found in two shallow graves in the desert. None of the victims was wearing shoes, authorities testified. All died of blunt force trauma. Suspect no stranger to family Summer and Gianni were found in "Grave B," as investigators dubbed it, along Interstate 15 near Victorville; her husband lay in "Grave A," along with the scattered bones of the younger boy, Joseph Jr. Grave B also held what authorities say was the murder weapon: a 3-pound Stanley sledgehammer. Investigators believe it came from the family's home in Fallbrook in San Diego County. Joseph and Summer's skulls had been smashed multiple times. The boys' skulls were fractured as well -- Gianni's as many as seven times, according to testimony. Joseph had a broken leg and rib. He was tied with an extension cord and wrapped in a futon cover taken from the Fallbrook house, a detective testified. The evidence heard so far seems to indicate the family was accosted and perhaps even bludgeoned to death at home. Signs of renovation work -- paint and new hardwood flooring -- were found in the open kitchen and family room. Summer McStay wore no top when her body was unearthed, and her bra was spattered with paint. The paint color matched the paint found in the home, according to testimony. The sledge hammer contained smears of the same paint. Merritt was among the first to raise the alert about the missing McStays. He told their family he couldn't reach McStay and helped a brother search the house. 'I have absolutely no clue' on McStay family's slaying, Merritt said in interview Although Merritt denied he'd ever driven the family's Isuzu Trooper, his DNA was found on the steering wheel and gear shift. The truck was found abandoned near the Mexican border soon after the family disappeared. Judge Smith also heard from an FBI agent who analyzed phone records. He found 27 calls between Merritt and Joseph McStay on February 4, 2010 -- the last day the family was seen alive. Merritt called McStay five times the next day, but none the day after that, February 6. On that morning, Merritt's phone pinged off cell towers in the Victorville area, where the graves were unearthed three years later. Prosecutors on Monday also began to home in on a possible motive: money. A detective testified about several checks written to Merritt on McStay's business accounting software. They were written after the family disappeared but were backdated to February 4, 2010. The checks were printed but deleted from the software. They were deposited to an account Merritt set up on February 3. Asked about the checks, Merritt offered no explanation or gave conflicting stories, a detective testified. Merritt has previously spoken to the media about his relationship with the McStays and professed his innocence. Prosecutors ended their case Monday by citing an interview Merritt gave CNN's Randi Kaye before his arrest, in which he said, "I am definitely the last person [Joseph McStay] saw." In his ruling, the judge found the backdated checks and DNA in the Isuzu to be compelling evidence to hold Merritt for trial. He also noted that in interviews with police after the McStays' disappearance, Merritt referred to the McStays in the past tense. The cell phone pings near the grave sites on February 6 and tire tracks consistent with Merritt's Chevy pickup also support inference of his involvement in the crime, the judge found.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Why are we obsessed with Rachel Dolezal? (Opinion)  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Is Rachel Dolezal's case a distraction from more important questions about race and identity, or does it speak to us on a deeper level?</descricao>
            <corpo> (CNN)Rachel Dolezal, the white woman who passed as black, told the world this week, "I identify as black." Despite her resignation as president of NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington, the uproar over her racial deception has not subsided. And in light of Caitlyn Jenner's recent public declaration that she's really a woman and not a man, the issue of identity has become a national conversation. What is it about Dolezal's case that fascinates so many people? CNN Opinion invited authors and activists to weigh in with their views. Tara Setmayer: The dangers of lionizing a liar Up is now down. Left is now right. And apparently, orange isn't the new black; white is, in the bizarre world of Rachel Dolezal, simply because she says so. For days, the black intelligentsia and media have been debating all sides of Dolezal's deceptive behavior. On MSNBC, Professor Michael Eric Dyson claimed Dolezal, a white woman, is culturally "blacker" than African-American Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, among other ridiculous racial assertions. MSNBC host Melissa Harris Perry contemplated whether Dolezal could actually be black, despite being born to Caucasian parents of Czech and German decent. Seriously?! It seems like rationalizing the absurd has become a pastime of the Left. One thing is perfectly clear: Rachel Dolezal is a liar. She created a complex world of delusion and deception that she perpetrated for years. Whether that delusion stems from white guilt of the nth degree or some other pathology, it's dangerous to lionize a liar. Although she resigned from her post as the head of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP, the organization seemingly brushed off the controversy, claiming they "aren't concerned with the racial identity of their leadership." OK. But shouldn't lack of honesty be of concern? Does integrity even matter anymore? Apparently, not as long as you're ideologically aligned. An acceptance of an "anything goes because I feel like it" attitude is a recipe for disaster for a civil society. Are we now living in a world where absolute truths no longer exist? Where do we draw the line? We better figure that out soon before the Rachel Dolezals of the world become the new norm. Tara Setmayer is a former communications director for U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher and a CNN political commentator. Jeff Yang: Who really has white privilege? Rachel Dolezal's case mashes all the right buttons in an era where the rising tide of diversity is reshaping established institutions and challenging conventional concepts of culture and identity, as well as inclusion and belonging. For some white Americans, Dolezal is a validation of the highly suspect notion that melanin is a social advantage, and that "minorities" now have access to privileges that Caucasian counterparts do not. For many black Americans and other people of color, she is an example of how the shadow of white entitlement extends over just about every aspect of life in America ‚Äî how it shrouds even the ability to determine the bounds of one's own culture and community rather than have it defined by the whims of others. Dolezal is a distraction. Our country's problems with race run far deeper with much greater consequences for people risking more than just public embarrassment. And even that is suspect where Dolezal is concerned: There have been reports that she's fielding offers for a reality TV show, and other commentators note that her newly found celebrity status is likely to pay off at least in the form of a healthy book contract. But she's an understandable distraction, and not the first or the last that we'll see as we head to the imminent tipping point of a "majority minority" America. Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including Public Radio International's "The Takeaway" and WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." He is the co-author of "I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action" and editor of the graphic novel anthologies "Secret Identities" and "Shattered." Jess Row: The best possible outcome I hope the reason Rachel Dolezal is gripping America is because we're taking the moment to consider the absurdity, arbitrariness, and psychological violence of racism. When Dolezal changed her hair and darkened her skin, she was "lying about a lie," as Jelani Cobb puts it aptly in the New Yorker. She was replacing one convenient narrative with another. One way of understanding racism is that it makes us shy away from complexity, from awkwardness, from the sight of a white mother with black children, from questions like, "Where did you get her?" or "Where are you really from?" But the truth is that we are all related and subject to our own strange, interwoven desires. It doesn't mean we should act on, or even validate, those desires. Perhaps by encountering this story of deception and denial -- which it is, no matter how well-intentioned -- we can become more comfortable with not hiding from one another. That would be the best possible outcome. Jess Row is the author of the novel "Your Face in Mine" and two collections of short stories, "The Train to Lo Wu" and "Nobody Ever Gets Lost." Sophia Nelson: The raw nerve that Dolezal struck The reason "Ms. Rachel" (as I like to call her) grates on our nerves so badly as black women, is because she represents hundreds of years of us being invisible, and white women being heard. It is the classic case of the white female archetype who rescues the black woman from danger, like in "The Long Walk Home" starring Whoopi Goldberg and Cissy Spacek, or who tells our story like in "The Help" starring Viola Davis and Emma Stone. The black women's voices are muted while the white women's voices are not. Black women and white women have a complicated relationship. It dates back to slavery, when we were the property of white women, through the Jim Crow era as we worked as maids to white women, and up to present day as we now serve as managers and prot√©g√©es of white women. When we see Ms. Rachel with her kinky hair and fake bronze skin, it shakes us to our core. This kind of imitation is not a form of flattery. It's modern day blackface. It's a costume. It's a cheap imitation. And the true insult to injury for many of us is that Ms. Rachel has now been allowed on a national and global TV platform to give voice to our black experience. Yet, real black women are often tossed about like a political football when it suits others to climb on our backs so that they can stand up. If a white woman can pretend to be us, and be given a voice to speak for us and our experiences as a black woman, what do we have left? In a world that stereotypes us as angry, loud, too much of this and not enough of that, Rachel Dolezal proves once again that really we still don't exist. Sophia A. Nelson is an author and journalist. Her new book is "The Woman Code: 20 Powerful Keys to Unlock Your Life." Simon Moya-Smith: Blackface gets attention, redface is ignored Rachel Dolezal has faced intense criticism for claiming to be black. But lest we forget, she and her estranged parents also claimed to be part Native American. Dolezal even went so far as to say she was born in a teepee and used to hunt with a bow and arrow. The truth of the matter is that claiming American Indian identity is so commonplace that rarely do people scrutinize it. What is most vexing about Dolezal's case is that being blackface is questioned whereas being redface goes ignored. Amid all the discussions of posing as black and assuming the race of others, the Chicago Blackhawks Stanley Cup victory on Monday produced a flood of fans in literal redface and faux Indian headdresses. They were playing Indian. But where's the outrage over that? While a sports fan's behavior may have different intentions, both the wannabe and the fan in redface make a mockery of another race. If we're going to speak out against blackface, we must also speak out against redface. Pretending to be black is widely perceived as outrageous, yet pretending to be redface continues to be celebrated as a tradition and a form of honoring Native Americans. That makes no sense.

Michaela Angela Davis: Dolezal's cultural colonization The Rachel Dolezal spectacle is anything but funny; for many, it's reprehensible and painful. It disturbed me on multiple levels. As a light skinned black woman, I found Dolezal's deception disgustingly disrespectful to the complex, brutal and heroic story of my actual black experience -- a slap in the face to my courageous black, white and indigenous ancestors. My grandfather was a masterful storyteller. He painted vivid pictures of his childhood in Sumpter, South Carolina, during the Jim Crow era. His stories and memories were real. Like the time his father stood on his porch, shotgun in hand and in defiance of a group of KKK members on horseback who rode by in the middle of the night intent on killing him for having an Irish wife. When Rachel Dolezal said she "owned the black experience," I, along with so many others, were enraged not only because real blacks live with relentless threat of violence and death, but she sought to take our actual stories, our story of resistance and survival. When black women like Renisha McBride get killed, how can a white person claim to "own" black experience? My mama was right: "One thing she can never own are our ancestors." Michaela Angela Davis, a writer and activist, was the executive fashion, beauty and culture editor at Essence, editor-in-chief of Honey magazine and fashion director for Vibe magazine. Dean Obeidallah: Will controversy change things? Look, we all know controversies about race get people talking. But when you add to that already provocative topic a woman who is white, claiming to be black and served as the head of a local chapter of the NAACP, it's a recipe for astonishment. Is she a con artist? Does she actually believe she's black? Is she delusional? On the heels of Caitlyn Jenner's transgender change, many asked whether a person can be transracial. Just about everyone has strong opinions about race and we all want to be heard. The real question is: Will Dolezal's story help us bridge the racial divide or better understand the social construct of identity? That would be a step forward, but it's not a probable outcome. In all likelihood she will simply be cited for years to come as a cautionary tale about not assuming that a person is the race she claims to be.

            <corpo>(CNN)One of two North Carolina teens injured in a weekend shark attack said he had little warning of what was to come. "I didn't see it coming," Hunter Treschl said from his bed at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington. "I was just in about waist-deep water, playing with my cousin ... and felt this kind of hit on my left leg ... like it was a big fish coming near you or something," the 16-year-old said in a series of videos released by the hospital. "Then it just kind of hit my arm. That was the first I saw it, when it was biting up my left arm."  Hunter was one of two teens who lost their arms in the waters off Oak Island on Sunday. His arm was amputated below the shoulder. Thirteen-year-old Kiersten Yow was the first swimmer attacked. She lost her arm at the elbow. The shark also bit her leg. The two attacks took place about 90 minutes apart. Kiersten's parents, Brian and Laurie Yow, said in a statement that their daughter was transferred from New Hanover to N.C. Children's Hospital in Chapel Hill on Monday, where"she remains in stable condition and is receiving excellent care." Her road to recovery will be long and will include surgeries and rehabilitation, they said, "but her doctors at (the University of North Carolina) expect she will keep her leg and for that we are grateful."  To have two shark attacks so close together is extremely rare, one expert said. "Having a series of injuries so close to each other in time and space makes this unusual," said George Burgess, an ichthyologist and fisheries biologist with the Florida Museum of Natural History. "It might suggest a single shark has been involved." Only three times in the four decades that he's been studying sharks has Burgess seen attacks happen "so closely in time and space," he said. The other incidents occurred in Egypt and Florida. Still Burgess said, shark attacks are unusual. Last year saw 72 attacks worldwide, only three of them were fatal. In a typical year, about four or five people are bitten by sharks on North Carolina beaches. Shark attack kills woman in Maui  Hunter said he was working to stay positive. "I've lost my arm obviously, so I have kind of two options," he said. "I can try to live my life the way I was and make an effort to do that even though I don't have an arm or I can kind of just let this be completely debilitating and bring my life down and ruin it." Hunter said he chooses to "fight and live a normal life" despite losing his arm. Messages of support have helped maintain his positive outlook. "I've gotten a massive amount of messages from people all over who've wished me well," he said. Hunter said he can't wait to get back home to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to see his friends.

            <descricao>U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin: Pope Francis' new encyclical on climate change is a profound reminder we have a shared moral obligation to address climate change.</descricao>
            <corpo>U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)Pope Francis' new encyclical on climate change is a profound reminder that we have a shared moral obligation to address climate change and the immeasurable human suffering it is causing around the world. Climate change is causing irreparable harm to people who least can afford to adapt to the increasing instances and severity of extreme weather. To echo the encyclical, released Thursday, if you care about your fellow human beings, then you should support solutions that will help people survive climate change and work to reduce the climate pollution that endangers us all. My Jewish faith has informed my sense of personal responsibility to work to protect people from climate change. Just last month, more than 340 rabbis from across the spectrum of Judaism penned a letter urging action to tackle the climate crisis. In that letter, they cite a passage from the Torah that warns that even if we refuse to let the Earth rest, it will rest anyway. That Biblical warning is playing out before us now. Climate change is already affecting the environment and economy in the state I represent. Seventy percent of Marylanders live in coastal areas, and the 2014 National Climate Assessment identified our state's 3,000-plus miles of coastline as highly vulnerable to rising seas. Recent superstorms such as Irene and Sandy have also wrought damaging floods in places such as Annapolis and Baltimore, while the people of Smith Island are watching their island disappear under rising sea levels. And it's not just in my state. Severe changes are taking place across the country as well. This year alone we have seen unprecedented drought in California and unprecedented flooding in Texas. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration informs us that May was the wettest month in U.S. history. Special coverage: How 2 degrees are key to climate change But the effects beyond the United States could be even more severe, and will disproportionately impact the world's most vulnerable people. The Maldives -- a string of 1,200 islands in the Indian Ocean with an average elevation of 5 feet -- might be completely uninhabitable in the coming decades. Indeed, the country's president is already reportedly seeking to purchase a new plot of land in India, Sri Lanka or Australia, where the country's 400,000 people can move to if the islands are ultimately submerged. The Sahel region in Africa spans 17 countries and is home to about 309 million people -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. population -- the vast majority of whom rely on subsistence farming. Increasing desertification in the region means less water for agricultural and personal use, leading to thinner harvests and greater risks of disease and famine. As a low-lying country on the world's largest river delta, the impoverished country of Bangladesh may be the worst affected. The confluence of rising sea levels, melting Himalayan glaciers and increasingly heavy monsoon rains have led scientists to predict that nearly 20% of the country could be underwater by 2050, displacing anywhere between 18 million to 50 million people. The moral obligation to act to solve the climate crisis becomes even clearer when one realizes that the people who will be hardest hit by climate change have made a negligible contribution to bringing about climate change. Powerful quotes from the Pope's encyclical That's why President Barack Obama has led the charge in helping developing countries to prepare for the impacts of climate change. Earlier this month, the President announced a new public-private partnership that will provide data, tools and training to countries that lack the ability to incorporate the effects of climate change into their economic growth strategies and disaster response plans. Empowering resource-strapped countries is a simple but important step in making sure that we prepare for and respond to our changing environment. As members of the global community, we all have an obligation to put a stop to the suffering of our neighbors. Our moral conscience, clarified for many by religious teachings, compel us to address the looming issue of climate change. As we approach a global climate change agreement later this year, I will continue work in the Senate to support strong measures to lower emissions at home and help lead the community of nations to lower global emissions. I hope that Pope Francis and his powerful voice can help further unite people around the world to collectively solve the climate crisis to the benefit of all. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>It wasn't the gaudy colors of Times Square that attracted photographer Franck Bohbot to New York City. It was the quiet street corners and lonely marquees.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)If Paris is the City of Light, then New York is the city of lights. In the Big Apple, they come in all sizes and all colors: HIDs and LEDs, Landlord's Haloes and expansive spotlights. They outline the Empire State Building and permeate Times Square. New York may have competition -- Tokyo and Las Vegas have their own parades of illumination -- but "the city that never sleeps" is in a league of its own when it comes to keeping you awake. Photographer Franck Bohbot, a native of the Paris area, is captivated by the lights of New York. However, it wasn't the gaudy colors of Times Square that attracted the 35-year-old Brooklyn resident. It was the quiet street corners and lonely marquees of the naked city. "When I moved to New York City in 2013, I started to walk late at night," he said in an email. "I very quickly became fascinated and (determined) to create a series of pictures at night with the everyday places where the people used to go in general: restaurants, bars, theaters, peep shows, cinemas, delis, shops, clubs. "It is," he added, "the streets." His photographs have been turned into a series, "Light On," which he shot from 2013 until this year. Some of the sights are familiar. One shot features the art-deco Radio City Music Hall, which dates to 1932. Another features Harlem's Apollo Theater, which opened in 1934. They remain grand throwbacks to the city's past, though Bohbot has shot both among deserted sidewalks, giving them a slightly haunted feeling. Perhaps more intriguing, however, are the smaller establishments. A lonely cross looms over a street in Manhattan's Alphabet City neighborhood. On the opposite side of Manhattan, a liquor store advertises its wares in Tribeca. And then there's Greenwich Village's Cafe Wha?, a landmark best known for hosting Bob Dylan and the Velvet Underground in the 1960s. Today it's a thriving rock club, but through Bohbot's lens the venue -- shot amid icy sidewalks and plowed snow -- suggests the scruffy music den it once was. "I just try to have a pictorial approach and make these photos like they were from movie stills," he said. Among his references are film director Martin Scorsese and painter Edward Hopper, the latter known for such austere paintings as "Nighthawks" and "Automat." Bohbot said the emptiness in his images is deliberate. It makes the photos more dramatic, almost literally so. "I started to have photographs empty of people," he said, though in some cases figures would step into the frame. "A little bit of patience was important to control the frame and composition. Framing, waiting, contemplating and documenting, too. "I want to be at the limit of fiction and reality." There you'll find millions of stories -- one for every light in New York City. Franck Bohbot is a French photographer based in New York City. You can follow him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. </corpo>

            <descricao>Mitt Romney wrote a strongly worded tweet calling for South Carolinians to send the flag to a museum.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)Republicans on Sunday demurred when asked whether South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of the state capitol, attempting to avoid a potential landmine in the first-in-the-south presidential contest. Both presidential hopefuls and South Carolina leaders have been asked whether they believe the flag should be removed from the grounds in Columbia after a man inspired by racial hatred admitted to killing nine parishioners of an African-American church in Charleston earlier this week. Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, two Republican presidential candidates courting the vote of social conservatives who play an outsized role in South Carolina, declined to voice their personal opinion on whether the flag should fly in Columbia, pegging it as a states' rights issues that doesn't rise to the Oval Office. RELATED: Hillary Clinton calls Lindsey Graham "It's not an issue for someone running for president," said Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas on NBC's Meet the Press. "Everyone's being baited with this question as if it has anything to do whatsoever with running for president." "I'm not a South Carolinian," said Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, on ABC's This Week. "This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina." Other Republican contenders, from Ted Cruz to Marco Rubio, have adopted a similar position, saying in the immediate aftermath of the killings that they would not encourage South Carolina leaders to act one way or another. That tone fits with their predilection to support states' rights -- but it also gives the aspirants a chance to largely avoid angering the endorsers who can give a jolt of energy ahead of the pivotal South Carolina primary next year. But it may grow harder for the GOP to maintain their reticence. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, wrote a strongly worded tweet calling for South Carolinians to send the flag to a museum. "Take down the #ConfederateFlag at the SC Capitol. To many, it is a symbol of racial hatred. Remove it now to honor #Charleston victims," Romney tweeted. Ben Carson, the sole African-American presidential candidate, said the flag wouldn't have "made a difference" when it comes to preventing future tragedies, though he recognized "some things are inflammatory." "The Confederate flag causes a lot of people angst and they are not able to see beyond that," Carson said on Fox News. "I think the people of South Carolina should sit down and have an intelligent discussion about what can they use that captures their heritage, captures the heritage of America and allows them to coexist in peace." Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, pledged Sunday to be a part of that debate. But Scott declined to reveal his position on whether to move the flag on CBS's Face the Nation. "For some, that flag represents that history. And for so many others, it represents a pain and oppression. I'm looking forward to our state leaders getting together, and having a robust conversation after the funerals about what's the next step," Scott said. "I am going to make sure that I'm a part of that conversation. My voice will be clear. My position will be stated."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Whack-a-mole is not a strategy - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Just picking off the leaders of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda isn't an effective strategy </descricao>
            <corpo>Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." (CNN)American counterterrorism officials have had much to celebrate in recent days: the killing of ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in Syria and the trove of "intel" that was taken from his residence by U.S. special forces; the death of the leader of al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, in a drone strike; and the possible death in Libya of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of a virulent North African jihadist group. But the leadership of these groups is generally replaceable. Consider the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS, until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006. Since then, a number of other leaders from al-Zarqawi's group have been killed, but that did not prevent from ISIS becoming ISIS -- a group that today lords over millions of people and occupies territory in Syria and Iraq that is around the size of the United Kingdom. To be sure, any counterterrorism campaign that eliminates many leaders of a group can have a real impact -- al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan is a shadow of what it once was, in part, because of a deadly campaign of CIA drone strikes that eliminated many of its leaders and middle managers. Yet, if we zoom out to the bigger picture, from Libya on the northern coast of Africa to Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the spaces in which jihadist militant groups can operate have greatly opened up as a result of the early promise of the Arab Spring turning into the grim reality of the Arab winter. The resulting chaotic conditions and weakened states have proven a boon to ISIS and to al Qaeda and its affiliates: -- In Yemen, al Qaeda has taken advantage of the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Hadi government to seize control of large swaths of southern Yemen, including the country's fifth largest city, Mukalla. -- In Libya, jihadist groups including ISIS control about a tenth of the country, according to a senior U.S. government official. -- In Syria, al-Qaeda's local affiliate, the Nusra Front, together with ISIS are now the most powerful groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and each control large sections of the country. -- In Iraq, ISIS controls the second largest city, Mosul, and much of Anbar province, which is about a third of the landmass of the country. What to do about all this is a puzzle because much of Middle East is in the grip of a regional, sectarian civil war fomented by Iran and the Gulf States and is evolving into a Rubik's Cube-like problem that has no good solution, because when you move one piece of the cube it can create both solutions and a new set of problems simultaneously. To get a sense of how complex this Rubik's Cube is: Consider that the United States is training Syrian opposition forces to fight the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad, while it is also training Iraqi forces of the Iran-backed Iraqi government to fight ISIS. The U.S. therefore is effectively supporting both sides of the wars in Syria and Iraq. Describing problems is always, of course, much easier than solving them, but here are some ideas that can help the U.S. achieve its strategic goals in the Middle East -- dismantling ISIS and al Qaeda and avoiding a long-running sectarian regional civil war: Curtail the foreign fighter flow ISIS is taking around 1,000 casualties a month in U.S.-led airstrikes, yet it's also recruiting around 1,000 "foreign fighters" from around the Muslim world every month, so the military campaign against ISIS is something of a draw. The U.S. should put pressure on Middle Eastern countries, which supply the bulk of the foreign fighters to the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts, to curtail the flow of their nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has already made some strides in that direction, but this should also be a priority for other Arab governments. Let American soldiers go forward The exact number of U.S. troops in Iraq is not the germane issue right now. It's the constrictive rules of engagement that have been imposed upon them that prevent them from getting "outside the wire" of the bases that they are assigned to. What is needed are rules of engagement that allow U.S. forward air controllers calling in precise airstrikes as well as U.S. advisers embedded with Iraqi troops on the frontlines. Not only will this help to place more accurate air strikes on ISIS positions, but also Iraqi troops with embedded Americans will have better military advice and the comfort of knowing that they will get close American air support if ISIS threatens them. Right now that isn't the case. Step up the air campaign in Syria and Iraq One of the world's experts on counterinsurgency, New America fellow David Kilcullen suggests increasing the tempo of of the air campaign. Kilcullen points out that the average rate of coalition air strikes since last August into Syria and Iraq is about 10 per day, while in the successful air campaign against the Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, it was around 250 per day, suggesting that the U.S.-led coalition can still ratchet up the pressure on ISIS significantly. Resist calls to split Iraq up into Sunnistan, Shiastan and Kurdistan Iraq is a country where many of its citizens are products of Shia-Sunni marriages and cities like Mosul and Baghdad remain mixtures of many ethnic and religious groups. Trying to separate out Iraq into sectarian and ethnic cantons will only fuel the sectarian passions in Iraq and in the region. The model to avoid, albeit on a larger scale, was the disastrous 1947 partition of India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states in which 1 million people died. If the Iran nuclear deal gets done, use it as leverage to show al-Assad the door Use the goodwill tendered by a deal with Iran to have the Iranians pressure their close ally, al-Assad, to step down, while maintaining much of his regime in place. That way the coalition of Alawites, Christians and other regime supporters will be assured that if al-Assad goes, they won't have to go down with him and will have a stake in some kind of peace deal, rather than fighting to the death. Keep pressure on the Saudis not to resume their counterproductive air campaign in Yemen That campaign had the effect of further fracturing the already-fracturing country, which has benefited al Qaeda.

            <corpo>(CNN)A shooting at a child's birthday party that left one person dead and 11 wounded was a retaliation, Detroit Police Chief James Craig told WXYZ on Sunday. Attackers fired semiautomatic weapons Saturday night at the party attended by about 300 people, police said. Earlier reports said nine people were wounded. Police think the shooting was retaliation, Craig said to WXYZ. He noted the 20-year-old man who died had been shot about a month ago. Four of the injured people are still hospitalized, Craig told WXYZ. No children were shot People in the neighborhood are not helping officers find the shooters, Craig said. "You will allow this to continue if you do nothing," he said of the neighborhood. "We can't do it alone. This is not the time to be fearful. These are urban terrorists who do nothing positive for our neighborhoods." Dolunt said police are looking for the owner of an abandoned red car found across the street whose occupants they believe were shot. CNN's George Montgomery contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Kohn: Trump's outrageous Mexico remarks - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>We are an increasingly pluralistic and global nation. If Donald Trump doesn't like it, there's no one he can fire to change things. He should just quit. </descricao>
            <corpo>Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)There were about three seconds on Tuesday when I was excited about the idea of Donald Trump running for president, if only for the entertainment value. Then he opened his mouth. Perhaps the lowest point, in a speech filled with low points, was when Trump started bashing Mexico and Mexicans -- and, in so doing, also bashed the fundamental values on which our own nation is founded. "When Mexico sends its people," Trump said during his presidential announcement, "they're not sending the best. They're not sending you, they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they're telling us what we're getting." Let's spend a moment on that, shall we? Trump is explicitly playing into an us-versus-them narrative that is not only factually dumb but divisive and dangerous. Maybe we shouldn't be surprised, given Trump has continually questioned the authenticity of President Barack Obama's birth certificate, but it's shocking nonetheless. In Trump's formulation, it's not just Mexicans who are evil -- they're all rapists and drug lords, Trump asserts without any facts to base this upon -- but Mexico the country is also evil, deliberately sending "those people" with "those problems." Trump is not only preying on, but feeding the xenophobic fears of mostly conservative white Americans who see immigration not as about economic realities but as a national threat -- people who use rhetoric about "hordes" "swarming" the border, which is also the kind of talk that undermines any notion of humane immigration policy. I also hope it goes without saying how deeply offensive such comments are not only to Mexican-Americans, but Latino Americans in general. And frankly, it should offend every American whose own ancestors once came to this country as immigrants, immigrants who were almost all at one point denigrated and demeaned by the majority. Immigration and integration are among the best parts of America's story. Xenophobia and racial bias run through our ugliest chapters. "I will build a great, great wall on our southern border," Trump continued in his speech, "and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words." Never mind that we already have a significant fencing system along key parts of the border, and that Border Patrol agents laying more fencing will not stop desperate migrants and crafty smugglers. Facts are nothing to Trump. Nor, apparently, is common sense. How, for example, would he get Mexico to pay for such a wall, especially if the country is as wicked as Trump suggests? One also wonders why he's not concerned there's no fence at all along the northern border. Canada must not be an evil nation. "The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everyone else's problems," Trump thundered. But actually, the world has become a dumping ground for U.S. economic policy. And few countries feel this more than Mexico, where our free trade agreements opened the border to cheap American-grown corn -- cheap because it's subsidized by our tax dollars -- which flooded the Mexican market and killed local agriculture. By 2001, just seven years after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, one out of every three tortillas in Mexico was made with imported corn, one report suggests. And a similar dynamic affected other crops and industries. We've literally been dumping our cheap subsidized crops and low-wage factories in Mexico -- not the other way around. Immigrants don't generally leave their families, home countries and everything they've ever known just because they want to -- it's usually because they feel they have no choice. You would think a successful businessman would know the realities of these economic and policy forces. But certainly, we should expect such basic knowledge in our president. Of course, there's no way Trump will become president. Polling suggests Trump is, in fact, the most disliked political candidate since 1980. And that's saying a lot. But Trump isn't in this election to win; he's in this election to spout off his own fringe views -- cheered on by a tiny but equally loud right wing of the Republican base. Somehow, like Trump, the more absurd and self-destructive and marginal those views become, the louder they are yelled. We are an increasingly pluralistic and global nation, and hopefully increasingly inclusive nation as well. If Trump doesn't like it, there's no one he can fire to change things. He should just quit.

            <descricao>Charleston church shooting brings calls for Confederate flag to be removed from grounds of state Capitol by top politicians, including Gov. Nikki Haley.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)A day after thousands mourned the slayings of nine black worshippers at Charleston's Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, leaders of diverse ages, races and backgrounds came together to say a symbol of segregation has no place at the state Capitol. Remove the Confederate flag that has flown at the state Capitol complex, they demanded. Put the relic of history where it belongs, in a museum. On Monday, three of the state's most prominent politicians -- Gov. Nikki Haley and Sens. Tim Scott and Lindsey Graham -- said they agreed. "Today we are here in a moment of unity in our state without ill will to say it is time to remove the flag from our Capitol grounds," Haley said. Earlier in the day, local leaders announced they would hold a rally at 11 a.m. Tuesday in front of the State House, just before the General Assembly goes into session, asking lawmakers to remove the controversial flag from the Capitol grounds. "The time has come for the General Assembly to do what it ought to have done a long time ago, which is to remove this symbol of division and even of terrorism to some," the Rev. Nelson B. Rivers said at a news conference. He said the flag symbolizes the worst of South Carolina's history and belongs in a place where it can be viewed as history. Removing it, he said, would honor the people killed at Emanuel AME. Dylann Roof, a white 21-year-old, has said he shot the black worshippers in hopes of sparking a race war, an official told CNN. Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley echoed Rivers. "The Confederate battle flag, years and years ago, was appropriated as a symbol of hate," he said, and having it fly at the state Capitol "at best sends mixed messages to those who want to understand it as a part of history." The flag is "so often used as a symbol of hate," he said. "It has been (used in) defiance to civil rights and to equal rights and equality among races, a symbol used by the Klan, and a symbol you saw at every protest event during times of integration." Mentioning Roof by name, Riley said, "For (people who have) those kinds of feelings -- and I hope there are very few -- it sends the wrong message" to fly the flag in a place symbolic of the rule of law. Later in the day, in Mississippi, that state's House speaker said his state's flag similarly needs to change. "We must always remember our past, but that does not mean we must let it define us," Speaker of the House Philip Gunn said in a statement. "As a Christian, I believe our state's flag has become a point of offense that needs to be removed. We need to begin having conversations about changing Mississippi's flag." The Mississippi flag has a Confederate flag incorporated into the top left corner. First on CNN: Graham to call for flag's removal On Sunday at the church, at a service to memorialize the nine who were killed, a chair sat empty with a black cloak draped over it. It's where the Rev. Clementa Pinckney would have been sitting, had the pastor and eight other worshippers not been shot down as they studied the Bible. But beyond the pain, hymns and gratitude also filled the church. "The doors of the church are open," the Rev. Norvel Goff declared. "No evildoer, no demon in hell or on Earth can close the doors of God's church."  While the call to remove the flag grows, investigators are examining a website registered to Roof. It features a 2,000-word racist manifesto that details the writer's philosophy of white superiority. "I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country," the author wrote. The website, called the Last Rhodesian, doesn't have Roof's name anywhere on it, but he is shown in many of the photos. Some photos show him burning and spitting on an American flag or holding a Confederate flag. On Friday, Roof appeared at a bond hearing. Families of the victims addressed him and did something many didn't expect: they said they forgave him. "I'm reminded of some news media persons that wondered why the nine families all spoke of forgiveness and didn't have malice in their heart," Goff said during the Sunday church service. "It's that the nine families got it." And if the gunman was trying to start a race war, he failed. "Lots of folks expected us to do something strange and break out in a riot," Goff said. "Well, they just don't know us," he said, as the congregation stood and cheered.  Protesters spanning all ages and races filled the front grounds of the state Capitol over the weekend, calling for the Confederate flag to be removed. "Take it down, take it down," the crowd chanted. The dilemma of what to do with the Confederate battle flag -- a symbol of racism to many and of Southern heritage for others -- has flustered lawmakers for years. As part of a compromise in 2000, lawmakers agreed to remove the Confederate flag from the top of the Capitol dome and place it across the street while also adding a monument to African-Americans. But the legislation mandated that only a supermajority of the legislature could change that setup going forward. Republican state Rep. Doug Brannon has already committed to introducing a bill to remove the flag when the Legislature convenes in January. "Personally, I have believed for years it needed to be in a museum," Brannon told CNN's Poppy Harlow. "I apologize to the people of South Carolina. I've been in the House for five years. I should have introduced this bill five years ago." Asked why he didn't file a bill before, Brannon replied: "I didn't do my job."  The White House said Monday that President Barack Obama will travel to Charleston on Friday, and he will deliver the eulogy at the funeral for Pinckney. Vice President Joe Biden will also attend the funeral, the White House said. Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Charleston; Holly Yan and Ashley Fantz wrote from Atlanta.

            <descricao>The man wanted in the killing of a New Orleans police officer is  custody after a "a relentless" 24-hour manhunt, according to police.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The man accused of killing a New Orleans police officer on Saturday apparently had access to two guns at the time of the slaying -- even though he had been searched and was handcuffed and in the backseat of a squad car, police said Sunday. "We realize that's an obvious issue," New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison said at a news conference. "We're going to get to the bottom of that." Travis Boys, 33, was being taken to jail early Saturday by Officer Daryle Holloway when Holloway was shot dead. Boys fled the scene and was the focus of a "relentless" 24-hour manhunt before he was taken into custody Sunday morning as he was attempting to board a bus, police said. Harrison said Sunday that Boys will be charged with first degree murder in the death of Holloway, who was 45. "From the moment that this tragic event happened, we brought together ... many people and resources to track down this suspect and bring him to justice," Harrison said Sunday. But the question remained how Boys could have managed access to two weapons found at the scene of the killing -- a .38-caliber handgun that had been the reason Boys was arrested on Friday night, and a .40-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson believed to have been used to shoot Holloway. Both weapons were recovered in Holloway's patrol car, and the officer's gun was still in its holster, police said. Boys had been arrested Friday night for aggravated assault in an incident in which he allegedly fired a .38-caliber weapon, according to NOPD. "Night watch officers at the 5th District Station frisked Boys for any weapons and subsequently turned Boys over to the day watch to transport Boys to the Orleans Parish Prison," police said in a statement. The task of transferring Boys to Orleans Parish Prison fell to Holloway, a 22-year NOPD veteran. Before the four-mile ride from the district station to the jail concluded, Holloway was dead, and Boys was missing. Police believe Boys used the Smith &amp; Wesson to kill Holloway. "How Boys was able to retrieve this weapon is still under investigation," read a statement from police. When police arrested him Sunday morning, Boys was still wearing the remnants of "busted" handcuffs, the chief said. As to how Boys managed to free his hands, "we don't know," Harrison said.

            <descricao>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs was arrested Monday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon at a UCLA athletic facility.</descricao>
            <corpo>Los Angeles (CNN)Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs was arrested Monday, accused of assaulting someone with a kettlebell at the university where his son plays football. No one was seriously injured in the incident at the Acosta Athletic Training Complex on the University of California at Los Angeles campus, which took place around 12:30 p.m., said school spokesman Phil Hampton. Officials did not disclose the alleged victim of the assault. But TMZ,which first reported the story, said Combs scuffled with a coach during a practice session. Combs' son Justin is a red-shirt defensive back on the school's football team. CNN was unable to reach Combs' representatives for comment. Combs was charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of making terrorist threats and one count of battery, the university said. Bond was set at $160,000 and Combs will have to appear in court on July 13, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Shortly before the incident, Combs, 45, posted a photo on his Facebook page of a father-son football game, with the caption, "WE WON! Happy Father's Day." It isn't known when or where the photo was taken. "I'm thankful that our staff showed the level of professionalism that they did in handling this situation," UCLA football coach Jim Mora said in a statement. "This is an unfortunate incident for all parties involved." The coach said the school won't be commenting further as it lets the "the legal process run its course." CNN's Dottie Evans reported from Los Angeles and Sam Stringer from Atlanta. CNN's Melonyce MacAfee also contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>CNN Hero Inez Russell's nonprofit enlists advocates and friends for seniors in Texas who need a helping hand.</descricao>
            <corpo>Waco, Texas (CNN)Inez Russell grew up believing that everyone had someone to care for them. But in 1989, she learned that was not the case. While visiting her father in the hospital, Russell heard a woman screaming. "I found this lady who was close to 90, and she was crying," Russell said. "She grabbed my arm and said, 'I'm dying, and I don't want to die alone. Please don't leave me.'" See more CNN Heroes That encounter led to another, then another. Russell began seeing firsthand the countless struggles faced by elders living alone. One woman lived in the dark because she had no one to change the light bulbs. Another couldn't remember the last time she had a meal. And Russell said many were taken advantage of financially, losing their money and their homes. In the United States, more than 11 million senior citizens live alone. The elderly are often invisible and forgotten, especially with so many in nursing homes or living alone in their own homes. And it's a population that is growing fast. By 2030, one in five U.S. citizens will be 65 or older, according to U.S. Census Bureau projections. To help this frail and vulnerable population, Russell started Friends for Life. The nonprofit enlists advocates and friends for seniors in Texas who need a helping hand. Since 1986, Russell and her group have helped 22,000 people navigate a variety of difficulties. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 CNN sat down with Russell to talk about her work. The following is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: What are some of the things your volunteers do to help the elderly? Inez Russell: We try to do the things that they can't do for themselves anymore. That might mean taking them to the doctor, taking them grocery shopping or grocery shopping for them, run errands. Sometimes we do minor house repairs, paint their house, or mow their yard. I can't think of anything that we wouldn't do to help a senior. We want to help people live independently as long as they can, so they can stay in their own homes. Many of our volunteers feel like they are family to these folks. And I think our clients feel that way, too. CNN: Sometimes your group takes on huge responsibilities, too, like medical decisions. How does that work? Russell: Seniors can be at risk for a lot of reasons. One is that they become more fragile and less able to defend themselves. They are often taken advantage of, sometimes because they want a friend so badly that they'll listen to anyone. We serve as legal guardian for people who are not able to make decisions for themselves. We will decide where they live, make sure they are clothed and fed, even meet them at the emergency room at 2 a.m., if needed. In our money management program, we help with bill paying; we can intercede with creditors. We make sure they're paying the least amount for services and products. We work to make sure that they don't end up paying fees and late charges. By managing their money, they end up having more money than they have had in the past, and they can make their checks go a lot farther. CNN: How did you first discover this need? Russell: I was visiting my father in the hospital. I heard a woman screaming, and I went to see what was wrong. I found this lady who was close to 90, and she was crying. She grabbed my arm and said, "I'm dying, and I don't want to die alone. Please don't leave me." So I stayed, and she told me her whole life story. She had children and grandchildren, but no one was coming to see her anymore. She was sure that meant she was dying; if she was going to live, people would still be coming. I bought her a stuffed animal. I got her some flowers. But mostly I listened. She decided I wouldn't be doing all that if she were dying. She got well and went home. Then the nurses said, "There's another lady that doesn't have anyone. Would you visit her?" And I did. The same thing happened. I just started wondering who helps these people who don't have a support system. And I couldn't find anything. CNN: Why is it that so many elderly are alone and more vulnerable today? Russell: Our society has become very mobile, and their families are now far away. And even though they care about their elderly family, they're not able to do the things for them that these folks need. And that means that sometimes a very small problem becomes huge because there's no one that they can call. But these people often don't have anybody. So if we can make friends with these people, we can build bridges. Then they'll know who they can call to get help. We all need somebody who can advocate for us. We all need somebody who cares and can come to our aid if we need help. Want to get involved? Check out the Friends for Life's website at friendsforlife.org and see how to help.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Washington (CNN)This week more than 400 Chinese officials are descending on Washington for three days of political, security and economic talks. The countries top diplomats and finance officials are gathering for the annual U.S.-China strategic and economic dialogue, viewed as an important forum managing ties between the world's two leading economies. The breadth of the talks, now entering their seventh year, reflects efforts to deepen and strengthen ties between the global powers. But this year's dialogue is clouded by mistrust and heightened tensions over China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and suspicions Beijing was behind a massive hack on U.S. government computers in which millions of personnel files were stolen. RELATED: 5 awkward conversations for Ash Carter and Chinese general Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's executive vice foreign minister, Zhang Yesui, led talks between civilian and military officials on Monday to discuss security issues. On Monday night, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew are hosting China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang for a private dinner, before the two days of talks of political and economic talks officially kick off on Tuesday. A senior State Department official briefing reporters said Monday's discussions were already "candid and to the point" and that the aim of the security discussions was to "really try to get at those issues which are the most likely to drive strategic mistrust between the U.S. and China." "The talks are all the more important for the need to address these issues head on, not try to paper them over, not try to agree to disagree," the official said. "But to try to actually talk about them, and see if we can in particular kind of try to narrow the differences but certainly at least make sure that we're communicating clearly on the areas of difference so that we don't miscalculate, misunderstand, etc." Both sides are emphasizing areas of cooperation between the two countries, like diplomacy on North Korea and a nuclear deal with Iran, climate change, Afghanistan and fighting the Ebola virus. "We have agreed with the Chinese that we are going to try to expand those areas where our interests overlap and expand cooperation in those areas," the senior State Department official said. But the official insisted the discussions will be "candid and to the point" and they will not "paper over" differences related to the South China Sea and cybersecurity. "What we're trying to do is to show that we can effectively manage areas of ongoing differences and work to narrow those differences over time," the official said. Danny Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, set the scene for the talks on Thursday, saying a direct approach was best. "We don't turn a blind eye to problems. We discuss them and we seek to tackle them directly," he said. "We don't always see eye-to-eye but the fact is global challenges require that we cooperate." The scale of Chinese building and militarization of man-made islands in the South China Sea has raised concern in the region about Beijing's territorial ambitions. Last month the U.S. flew a rare and highly publicized military surveillance flight in the area to highlight the massive scale of activity. China calls the islands its sovereign territory, but the U.S. has said China is building in disputed waters and is threatening freedom of navigation in sea lanes which are key for international trade. Russel called last week's announcement by China that it planned to continue and expand construction on reclaimed outposts "troubling." "Neither that statement, nor that behavior, contributes to reducing tensions," Russel said. "We consistently urge China to cease reclamation to not construct further facilities and certainly not to further it." The already tense relationship between the U.S. and China over cybersecurity has recently become more fraught after the Chinese suspended a separate track of talks to discuss the issue a year ago when the U.S. charged five Chinese military officers with hacking. Although the cyber working group has not met since, Russel and other U.S. officials have said cybersecurity would be raised throughout the talks, both from a security context and an economic one. RELATED: Obama's troubled trade agenda may get new life "Certainly the issue will be addressed in pretty direct terms with the Chinese," the senior State Department official said Monday. The talks area as much about U.S.-China financial ties as political ones, and take place against the backdrop of China's growing economic influence across Asia. Questions about U.S. economic leadership in the region come on the heels of Congress' rejection of fast-track trade authority for President Barack Obama's landmark Asia-Pacific trade deal. Progress toward a bilateral investment treaty between the two countries has also been slow. Both sides have an interest in reducing tensions ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the White House in December, his first since taking office two years ago. China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as saying talks are an opportunity to "push for a new model of major power relationship." The Chinese story said climate change would be a "hot topic" at the upcoming dialogue, but did not mention cybersecurity or the South China Sea.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Hong Kong legislators reject China-backed reform bill - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A bill proposed by the Chinese government that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to vote for their next leader, with conditions, has been rejected.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)A bill proposed by the Chinese government that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to vote for their next leader -- as long as the candidates were approved by Beijing -- has been rejected by the city's legislature. In a vote Thursday, 28 out of Hong Kong's 70 lawmakers rejected the proposal. Eight voted in favor. As voting began, a large group of pro-government legislators attempted to stall the vote with a last-minute walkout of the chamber -- but the vote continued without them, leading to the bill's hefty defeat. The result was seen as a rebuke to the Chinese government, which has tried to bring Hong Kong closer to the mainland since it was returned from British rule in 1997. The bill was the subject of much contention in Hong Kong and came in the wake of massive street protests that gripped the city last fall. Democracy supporters had refused to accept the proposal, saying that electing candidates vetted and approved by a Beijing loyalist committee would amount to "fake universal suffrage." Pro-democracy legislator Albert Chan, who voted against the bill, called the result a "victory." "We do not want to have a fake democratic system in Hong Kong," he told CNN. "We want to continue fight for genuine democracy." But Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker, told CNN the result was "highly regrettable... this does not bode well for governance."  The vote brought little resolution after years of intense disagreement over how to establish universal suffrage in Hong Kong -- a promise made to the city when it was returned from British to Chinese rule 17 years ago. Establishment lawmakers said the defeated bill would have fulfilled that long-awaited promise. But democracy supporters disagreed. "We are not gullible. We will not buy into such delusions for the sake of a quiet life," said legislator Claudia Mo during debate over the bill. "We have no choice but to vote against it." Now, the electoral reform process has effectively stalled. Hong Kong and China's governments have insisted there can be no new reform proposals, and have hinted at consequences for those who opposed them this time around. "As to who should be held liable, I think the answer is clear," said Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief secretary and the city's number two official, in the final moments of the bill's debate. Accusing pro-democracy legislators of holding the city "hostage," she said democratic elections might now be "dream that's never realized." In an editorial, China's state-run Global Times said the vote was a "humiliation" not for the country but for the those who voted against the bill, adding those lawmakers would "face the judgment of history and shoulder the responsibility eventually." A spokesperson for China's National People's Congress Standing Committee accused pro-democracy legislators of blocking the bill "for selfish reasons," according to the People's Daily, a mouthpiece for the Chinese government. The spokesperson said any future implementation of electoral reform in Hong Kong would still have to adhere to the vetoed proposal.  Democracy activists had hoped that mass civil disobedience would pressure the government into revising the reform proposal to allow for free and open elections. That led to the "Occupy Movement" or "Umbrella Movement," 79 days of sit-ins that snarled traffic in key areas of the city last fall. But with the protests cleared, the reform proposal dead and no short-term possibility for compromise, pro-democracy activists are setting their sights on a new horizon: The year 2047. That's when that Hong Kong's special status as a semi-autonomous Chinese territory officially expires, leaving its future an open question. Which is why student leader Joshua Wong, a key figure in last year's protests, told CNN on Wednesday that his activist group is no longer planning any occupation-style civil disobedience for the next one or two years. Instead, he announced a new goal: To fight for the right to "organize a referendum to decide the future of Hong Kong after 2047." "In last year's battle, we could not win," he said. "But in the future war, we can finally get back the right of Hong Kong people." Read more: Who is Joshua Wong? Watch more: What's next for Hong Kong's 'Generation Occupy'?

            <descricao>Called "Immersive Fitness," it's the first indoor gym studio with a 270-degree virtual-reality screen in the world.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)I'm cycling down a narrow, winding road at midnight. The full moon overhead casts an eerie glow on the craggy terrain around me. The only way out is just ahead: a dauntingly steep climb over a mountain pass. It looks like there's ice and snow in the distance, but right now, I'm working so hard, sweat is pouring off my body. And while it's breathtaking, the scenery isn't real. I'm nowhere near the Himalayas. Instead, I'm in an air-conditioned gym on the 14th floor of a Hong Kong skyscraper. It's not my first time in an indoor cycling class, but I've never experienced anything quite like this. Instead of staring at a mirror or trying to avoid comparing my form to that of clearly more experienced cyclists, I'm riding into a massive projector screen covered with landscapes. In true spinning style, the music is blaring and the instructors are pushing the class to the limit. "Are we ready? Hyperdrive!" they shout as we accelerate to what feels as close as you can get to warp speed on a bike.  It's called "Immersive Fitness." And it's the first indoor gym studio with a 270-degree virtual-reality screen in the world. The concept is a partnership between Hong Kong-based Pure Fitness, and New Zealand fitness giant Les Mills, which designs and provides the content. The aim: to leave reality behind and become fully immersed in animation and music to achieve a better workout. Other gyms have been trialing similar technology. And companies have been experimenting with Facebook's Oculus Rift virtual headset, to allow riders to cycle around the world, all without leaving the comfort of home. But back at the gym, we're riding "The Trip," a 35-minute journey through remote reaches of the galaxy. Parts of it look a lot like a retro video game. And that seems to be exactly the point. "What this technology is going to do is open up exercise to maybe a younger crowd," says Colin Grant, the CEO of Pure Group, which spent more than $400,000 building the studio. We're on a racetrack through a city of the future with glimmering skyscrapers towering overhead. There is competition here, of the virtual sort: cycling avatars on the screen that seem much better equipped than us for the three rigorous laps ahead. The starting line lights flash to green. I crank up my resistance dial and accelerate to racing speed. When the road rises, I stand and pedal harder. When it banks to the right, the entire class, without realizing it, leans into the curve. "Faster, faster, faster!" the instructors scream. Halfway through the second lap, my head starts playing tricks on me. I feel like I'm on a roller coaster. The hills, the drops and especially the turns, feel real. And for a moment, I forget where I am. Maybe this is why the class starts with a motion sickness disclaimer.  I've seen people lose their lunch in cycling class before, but somehow, we all make it through to the last track unscathed. That's when the darkness of outer space opens up, and suddenly, we're riding across the ocean into the sunset. Soon, we're joined by a flock of Canadian geese. It sounds cheesy, but it puts a smile on my face. My cycling mate, Rebecca Schrage, looks at me and laughs. "That was pretty tough," she says. "I love 3-D movies...that's exactly what it was like." Grant says the technology is only in its infancy, but he says there is huge growth potential, because the opportunities are limitless. "You could be following a jet ski...they could add scent. They could add mist," he says. There are also plans to expand the content to other classes including yoga. Sun salutations on the summit of Mount Everest anyone? It seems like a big experiment, and an expensive one at that. And while it may take a while to see if pedaling in front of a projector can turn a profit, this new trend has more than its share of fitness fans. "I'll do it again," Schrage says. "That was pretty good. I'm impressed."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho> A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's no accident that the first P8s were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and here it's watching China.</descricao>
            <corpo>Above the South China Sea (CNN)Take-off is swift on the U.S. Navy's P8-A Poseidon -- there's no slow roll down the runway on military flights -- and within minutes, the turquoise blue of the South China Sea comes into view from the window of America's most advanced surveillance and sub-hunting aircraft. The P8 crew, composed of more than a dozen naval aviators, invited me into the cockpit to watch and to listen. CNN last week first reported on this secret surveillance mission, which eight times received warnings from the Chinese navy to leave the contested area. This is a behind-the-scenes look at the journey. Approaching the P8-A Poseidon on the tarmac, it's easy to mistake the sophisticated aircraft for one of the many other Boeing 737 planes around it. The P8 is based on a 737 frame, but the similarities end there. Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Peeking out of the fuselage are numerous antennas, domes and camera wells, plus a bomb bay for sub-hunting torpedoes and spaces under the wings for Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Inside, the jet is home to an array of advanced intelligence-gathering equipment. I have the feeling of entering a CIA listening station in the sky. It's no accident that the first P8s -- only 18 months old -- were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and its principle mission here is keeping a watchful eye on China. Once we're aboard, we sit in on the flight crew's "delta briefing," the final briefing before takeoff. The aircraft's commander, Lt. Cmdr. Matt Simpson, lays out the mission plan. The P8 will leave from Clark Air Base in the Philippines and fly some 460 miles west to three reefs -- Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief -- which Beijing has rapidly been transforming into expansive islands and, the U.S. fears, soon-to-be permanent military stations 600 miles from China's coastline. From the air, the waters appear quiet and peaceful, but 60% of world trade traffics through here. And underneath the sea floor are believed to be enormous deposits of oil and gas. That helps explain the international free-for-all underway to claim an array of barely visible reefs and shoals. It's not only China but also the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei that are involved. Though the coastlines of the other countries are all closer than China's, they are still more than 200 miles away, far from their territorial waters, which by international law extend only 12 miles out from shore. America's own coastline is, of course, thousands of miles away, but the U.S. is still very much in the mix. It's the defender, in effect, of free passage through international waters for all international cargo ships and, crucially, the U.S. Navy. Forty-five minutes into the flight, the first mission target comes into view: Subi Reef. More than two dozen Chinese dredgers fill the lagoon, pumping sand from the ocean floor in huge plumes onto the surface, slowly and gradually building up an island from scratch. The scale and pace of their work is mesmerizing. In two years, China has expanded the surface area of reefs it claims in the South China Sea from just five acres to more than 2,000. The P8 crew expect the Chinese navy to warn them away as we approach. Usually these "challenges," as they refer to them, come once the jet is within a few miles, and indeed, the radio soon relays a voice speaking in Chinese-accented English: "This is the Chinese navy. This is the Chinese navy ... Please leave immediately to avoid misunderstanding." From both sides, the communication is calm and, mostly, professional. The American pilot quickly responds from a well-rehearsed script explaining that this is a U.S. aircraft operating in international airspace over international waters. U.S. threatens peace in South China Sea, Beijing says Still, as the Chinese navy radio operators come back on the line to repeat their warning, I can hear frustration building in their voices. In one case, the operator's voice grows louder and louder, ending in a high-pitched "You go!" The Chinese give warnings like this eight times during the flight. It turns out there are also civilian aircraft in the vicinity. A Delta Air Lines flight on that same frequency hears the Chinese challenge, and then pipes into the frequency to ask what's going on. The Chinese navy radio operator identifies himself, possibly to reassure them. The flight crew notes that this can be a very nerve-racking experience for civilian aircraft in the area. For now, these Chinese challenges are surface-to-air, coming from new early-warning radar stations they have positioned on the islands or from Chinese navy ships patrolling them. These reefs are too far from air bases in China for Chinese aircraft to intercept the P8 and start a potential confrontation in the air, but that may change if and when these islands have working airstrips. Fact is, China is already on its way. As we leave Subi Reef, we approach Fiery Cross Reef a few minutes travel away. Here China has made the most extensive progress. What used to be a rocky reef barely visible above the waves is now equipped with a nearly completed runway, a tower, an early warning radar station and barracks for Chinese soldiers and sailors. Meanwhile, Chinese dredgers continue to dig away at a deep-water harbor for Chinese ships. This is what some call China's "unsinkable aircraft carrier." If China continues to militarize the islands, as the U.S. fears, the three reefs will form strategic Chinese military bases right in the middle of some of the most contested waters in the world. On board the P8, the mood is calm and confident. These crews have been flying these flights for months now. But the more China builds, the U.S. sailors tell me, the more aggressively the Chinese navy is challenging them. CNN has learned that the U.S. is considering flying its aircraft -- and sailing its Navy warships -- even closer to the islands to further demonstrate that the U.S. does not recognize China's claims. The lowest we fly on this mission is 15,000 feet. But that could soon change. And what happens if China starts deploying its aircraft to these waters? The airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef is already long enough to accommodate every military aircraft in the Chinese arsenal. P8 flights hundreds of miles closer to the mainland are already intercepted by Chinese fighters. Last fall, in one such encounter, the Chinese pilot came dangerously close. The prospect of U.S.-Chinese collisions in the air are truly alarming, as past events have demonstrated. In 2001, a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. EP-3, the P8's predecessor, over Hainan Island, right off the Chinese mainland, leading to a major crisis as the damaged U.S. plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The P8 flight crew speaks confidently and calmly about their mission. But they know they are in the midst of a major and contentious potential conflict. Chinese protests are becoming more stern. U.S. surveillance flights and naval patrols are becoming more aggressive. And the two countries' positions are, for now, irreconcilable. China views these islands as its sovereign territory and describes its commitment to them as "unshakable." The U.S. views the area as international waters and airspace. Aboard the P8, it is difficult to see how those differences are resolved.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>How China's 'Great Cannon' works - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Nicholas Weaver: Researchers explain how China's "Great Cannon" is said to attack website targets. He says the implications are dangerous. </descricao>
            <corpo>Nicholas Weaver is a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley University. He was one of the lead authors of a report on China's "Great Cannon," which was released by The Citizen Lab in April. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's own. China hasn't directly addressed claims about the existence of the Great Cannon, but says it's interested in working with the international community to keep "cyberspace peaceful, secure, open and cooperative." (CNN)Readers may have heard of the "Great Firewall," the powerful filters that the People's Republic of China uses to prevent Chinese citizens from accessing the whole Internet. The Great Firewall monitors traffic entering and exiting China, and then disrupts prohibited content and connections. Imagine an eavesdropper on a party line: when one party says something objectionable, the eavesdropper shouts into the line until everyone hangs up. While very effective, the Firewall is not an offensive weapon. The device we dubbed the "Great Cannon" is different; it acts as a "man-in-the-middle," able to not just shout down a conversation but actually able to change content as it passes through the Internet. Unlike the Great Firewall, whoever designed the Great Cannon created a deliberately offensive tool, designed to selectively replace benign web content with malicious content. The only known use of the Great Cannon was to further Chinese censorship. Study: China cybercensors attack outside its borders with 'Great Cannon' The organization GreatFire seeks to monitor and circumvent Chinese censorship. One technique it's developed has been dubbed "Collateral Freedom" -- hosting content on encrypted services that it believes are "too important to block."  During March and April, when a non-Chinese web surfer visited a page containing unencrypted content served by Chinese search engine Baidu, the Great Cannon would occasionally replace that content with a series of instructions for the web surfer's browser. These instructions caused the browser to repeatedly fetch content from "Collateral Freedom" pages, executing a "denial of service" (DOS) attack. It would be like an attacker telling tens of thousands of cellphones to all dial the same number at the same time. The first round of attacks, between March 16 and March 26, directly targeted GreatFire's Amazon CloudFront instances in an attempt to either cause Amazon to remove these instances or simply run up GreatFire's hosting costs. Although this significantly affected GreatFire's bill, it failed to block the services and GreatFire responded with some technical changes to mitigate the attack. But GreatFire's CloudFront domains aren't memorable, so those in China who wish to discover one need another source. GreatFire uses Github for this, hosting both instructions for evading the Great Firewall and directions on obtaining a copy of the Chinese language New York Times. Previously, China tried blocking GitHub but quickly relented when local developers objected. So the Great Cannon's operator switched the target, instructing newly hijacked web browsers to repeatedly contact GitHub. This attack persisted until April 7, although GitHub was able to mitigate this attack after the first few days. Since then, the Great Cannon has gone silent; we have not detected any further attempts to use this device. While it still ran, we were able to isolate the Cannon's location, showing that it wasn't a group of hacker vigilantes but a dedicated tool that shares code and network location with the Great Firewall.  We don't expect that hackers would have access to the Great Firewall's source code or be able to install devices in the backbone of the Chinese Internet across multiple Internet providers. Combined with the choice of targets, the Great Cannon is almost certainly a tool of the Chinese government. Though the Great Cannon has gone silent, the dangerous implications remain. To start with, China seemed willing to explicitly attack a U.S. company, GitHub, in an attempt to suppress online content that the Chinese government finds objectionable. It would also be a trivial change for the Great Cannon's operator to turn the Cannon into a direct exploitation tool, targeting web servers directly. Instead of replacing content with the instructions to execute a DOS attack, the replaced content instead could exploit the target's browser to take over the target's computer. Combined with some target awareness and a minor change to the Cannon itself, the Chinese could use this to hack any web browser -- if the Chinese can identify their target's IP address and the target happens to fetch unencrypted content hosted from within China. The Great Cannon was also a direct attack on Baidu. For everyone outside of China, any page containing an unencrypted Baidu service, even something as innocuous as an advertisement, now may be a vehicle for a Chinese government attack. And although the Cannon primarily replaced content served by Baidu, it can just as easily target any other Chinese service. Anyone concerned with the possibility of Chinese government hacking now needs to consider the entire Chinese Internet as explicitly hostile. How can Chinese Internet companies hope to compete?  Although China's use of the Great Cannon to censor content is objectionable, if China instead chooses to use this to directly exploit computers, they would have company. According to recent revelations, the NSA in the United States and the GCHQ in the United Kingdom have developed and deployed an attack using similar techniques that they have used against Belgacom, Belgium's primary telecommunications provider. The Internet is now a hostile place. If an adversary sees your unencrypted traffic, it is not just a data leak but an attack vector they can use to exploit your computer. Encryption isn't just a matter of privacy but a necessity for self-defense.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Beijing rolls out China's toughest smoking ban - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A tough new ban on smoking indoors rolls out across the China's capital, with lighting up now prohibited in all offices, restaurants, bars and airports. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A tough new ban on smoking indoors rolls out across the Chinese capital Monday, with lighting up now prohibited in all offices, shopping malls, restaurants, bars and airports. Many outdoor public places such as the areas outside kindergartens and hospitals will also be required to be smoke-free. Businesses and institutions that flout the law will face fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600) and repeat offenders could have their licenses revoked. Bernhard Schwartl√§nder, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Beijing, says it's a "major advance" in tobacco control in China, where more cigarettes are smoked than anywhere else in the world. Here's five things to know as China battles its "smoking dragon."  It's not the first time Beijing has tried to tackle its smoking problem -- a previous ban launched in 2008 was widely ignored. After closing them with great fanfare, the airport quietly reopened the smoking rooms in its terminals. However, unlike previous efforts, this law has teeth -- flouters will face stringent fines. Individuals must pay 200 yuan ($32) (up from 10 yuan ($1.60)) and businesses risk a penalty of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600). Anyone who breaks the law three times will find themselves named and shamed on a government website. Schwartl√§nder at the WHO says effective enforcement in a city the size of Beijing will be a "colossal task" but the law "deserves to be regarded as a major step forward in the battle against the smoking dragon."  China is home to some 300 million smokers and some four million live in Beijing. More than one in every three cigarettes in the world is smoked in China. And those cigarettes are cheap -- as little as $1.50 for a popular brand like Zhongnanhai. According to the Tobacco Atlas, 26% of the price of a packet of cigarettes is tax, compared with a WHO benchmark of 75%. The China National Tobacco Corp makes one third of the world's cigarettes and is a state-run monopoly responsible for 3.6 million farmers, four million tobacco retailers and half a million related employees. Health authorities have, until now perhaps, been reluctant to take on the interests of a giant industry.  Northern China's smog-ridden skies have been linked to 1.2 million premature deaths a year but smoking is arguably a far more pressing health problem. According to the WHO, the city's concentration of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers -- known as PM2.5 -- can often reach 500 or more. While this dwarfs the WHO's recommended exposure of below 25 -- the smoke from just three cigarettes burning in a restaurant can result in a level of 600. "The smoke from 20 or more smokers, which is not unfeasible in a crowded bar or restaurant, will result in a PM2.5 level that will be off the chart," says Schwartl√§nder, writing in The Lancet.  Smoking is a handy icebreaker in China, a way to greet someone and few interactions aren't made easier by offering a cigarette. Until an edict by President Xi Jinping in 2013, it was common for government officials to have a cigarette in hand while performing their public duties. Chairman Mao Zedong and paramount leader Deng Xiaoping were renowned smokers. While the new ban will limit tobacco advertising, it might already be too late for the next generation. In 2013, a WHO survey found that among five to six year old children, almost nine in 10 can recognize at least one brand of cigarettes and one in five expect to be smokers when they grow up.  Some 45% of men smoke daily, according to 2013 figures, compared with just 2.1% of women -- this means that Chinese women endure some of the highest rates of exposure to second hand smoke in the world. It's hoped that this army of female non-smokers might prove to be a secret weapon in enforcing the new ban. At an event in Beijing on Sunday, groups of school girls and older women danced outside the "Bird's Nest" Olympic stadium, which was draped in anti-smoking banners. But new data shows that while the overall smoking rate has declined in the past decade, there has been a "significant increase" in women lighting up.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>U.S. government hack could actually affect 18 million - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Personal data of an estimated 18 million employees was compromised by a recent hack of the U.S. government -  four times what the agency has acknowledged. </descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)The personal data of an estimated 18 million current, former and prospective federal employees were affected by a cyber breach at the Office of Personnel Management - more than four times the 4.2 million the agency has publicly acknowledged. The number is expected to grow, according to U.S. officials briefed on the investigation.  FBI Director James Comey gave the 18 million estimate in a closed-door briefing to Senators in recent weeks, using the OPM's own internal data, according to U.S. officials briefed on the matter. Those affected could include people who applied for government jobs, but never actually ended up working for the government.  The same hackers who accessed OPM's data are believed to have last year breached an OPM contractor, KeyPoint Government Solutions, U.S. officials said. When the OPM breach was discovered in April, investigators found that KeyPoint security credentials were used to breach the OPM system.  Some investigators believe that after that intrusion last year, OPM officials should have blocked all access from KeyPoint, and that doing so could have prevented more serious damage. But a person briefed on the investigation says OPM officials don't believe such a move would have made a difference. That's because the OPM breach is believed to have pre-dated the KeyPoint breach. Hackers are also believed to have built their own backdoor access to the OPM system, armed with high-level system administrator access to the system. One official called it the "keys to the kingdom." KeyPoint did not respond to CNN's request for comment.  U.S. investigators believe the Chinese government is behind the cyber intrusion, which are considered the worst ever against the U.S. government.  OPM has so far stuck by the 4.2 million estimate, which is the number of people so far notified that their information was compromised. An agency spokesman said the investigation is ongoing and that it hasn't verified the larger number.  The actual number of people affected is expected to grow, in part because hackers accessed a database storing government forms used for security clearances, known as SF86 questionnaires, which contain the private information of multiple family members and associates for each government official affected, these officials said.  OPM officials are facing multiple congressional hearings this week on the hack and their response to it. There's growing frustration among lawmakers and government employees that the Obama administration's response has minimized the severity of breach.  OPM's internal auditors told a House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee last week that key databases housing sensitive national security data, including applications for background checks, had not met federal security standards.  "Not only was a large volume (11 out of 47 systems) of OPM's IT systems operating without a valid Authorization, but several of these systems are among the most critical and sensitive applications owned by the agency," Michael Esser, OPM's assistant inspector general for audits, wrote in testimony prepared for committee. Katherine Archuleta, who leads OPM, is beginning to face heat for her agency's failure to protect key national security data -- highly prized by foreign intelligence agencies -- as well as for how slowly the agency has provided information.  Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., at a hearing last week told Archuleta: "I wish that you were as strenuous and hardworking at keeping information out of the hands of hacker as are at keeping information out of the hands of Congress."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Stunning images chronicle China's dramatic changes - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Chinese photographer Wang Wenlan, 61, is one of the country's top photojournalists. His work is a rich chronicle of China's fast-changing society.   </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)When Chinese photographer Wang Wenlan first pressed the shutter on a borrowed Soviet camera in 1967, he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during Chairman Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. "I made rolls of film out of a motion-picture reel I found. The photographic paper was left over from printing Mao's portraits," Wang told CNN. Five decades later, Wang, 61, is one of the country's top photojournalists. His work is a rich chronicle of China's fast-changing society. "Still images are fragments, sections and points that connect the history," Wang says. "The whole process of China's reform over the past four decades -- whether going forward or stalling -- I've been determined to and have managed to document it all." One of his most famous series of photographs tracks China's relationship with the bicycle -- once a family's most precious asset but now fast vanishing from the streets.  Photography was an outlet for Wang during the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, when China was convulsed by violent class struggle. His family were labeled "capitalist roaders" and unlike most other kids, he couldn't join the red guards. Despondent, 14-year-old Wang wandered around Beijing with friends in similar situations, snapping pictures and portraits to distract himself. Taking photos turned into more than a pastime in January 1976, when Premier Zhou Enlai died - beloved by many for his role in tempering the worst of Mao's excesses. Wang went to Tiananmen Square with his camera, capturing the unprompted outpouring of grief, both then, and again in April that year. "I was in deep grief," Wang said, "And I felt I should record the collective grief." He kept the film secret from the military, which then employed him as a photographer, transferring it to friends. The photos were published in the early 1980s. From then on, Wang saw that his camera was much more than a memory keeper. "I didn't get photojournalism until then," he said. "My biggest regret was not to capture anything meaningful during the Cultural Revolution period; it would've been a precious record." In the decades following, Wang has photographed not only major events -- from Tangshan Earthquake in 1976 and the overthrow of the Gang of Four, to the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 -- but also intimate moments captured in China's changing countryside and growing cities.  From April 3, Wang will have the first overseas exhibition of his work in the United States at the University of Iowa. Curator Judy Polumbaum -- a Chinese media scholar and former colleague of Wang -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary China. "It reflects not only the many changes in Chinese society emerging over the past several decades but also the endurance of tradition, and the often striking and sometimes amusing clashes between tradition and change," she said. The clash between tradition and modernity is stark in the lead picture of the exhibit ‚Äî an elderly farmer looks on as a groom carries his bride through the field and "the couple's Western wedding garb contrasting with this longstanding custom," she says.  Wang has spent most of his career at the China Daily, the country's official English-language paper, which he joined in 1980 before its official launch. Back then, it broke the mold, using large photographs rather than the stamp-sized images used in most other Chinese newspapers at the time, he says. It was also unafraid to feature ordinary people on its pages, rather than national leaders -- something Wang found he excelled at. "Thanks to the China Daily, I stood out. It was an irreplaceable platform." Wang finds himself nostalgic for the 1980s, when ideas emerged and collided after the Cultural Revolution ended. "People thought nothing was impossible," he said. "We reflected on the past and were determined to move on. It was a special time; the air was filled with ideals, enthusiasm and all kinds of possibilities." Today's China is different, he said. "The country's goal has shifted toward a transition to a market economy since the 1990s," he said. "Individuals also have since switched their focus onto consumerism and incomes from ideals."  Throughout his career, Wang's focus has changed a great deal as well. He said he used to focus on the technical and artistic aspects of photography, but now, with smart phones, he says anyone can be a photographer. To Wang, what matters is the perspective, he said, pointing at his head. Wang says he's felt obligated to observe and criticize through his lens over the years. "My job isn't to chant slogans." "I take photos first. It's great if they can be published; if not, they'll eventually be part of the history." Next year will mark Wang's 40th year in photojournalism. He is planning to have a photo exhibition and wants to call it "Unfinished." The name was inspired by the alternative title of Franz Schubert's Symphony No.8. "China is unfinished," said Wang, who is also fan and critic of classic music. "It's always a work in progress."  </corpo>

            <corpo>London (CNN)China, a land of surveillance and increasing military might, is turning into a writer's paradise for those with a thriller to tell. Western authors say its rise has been pure gold for suspense novels, filling a gaping hole left by the end of the Cold War. China has its own pack of spy novelists too. "The mysterious side of China certainly lends itself to thriller writing," says novelist Adam Brookes. The second installment of his critically acclaimed Night Heron trilogy, a spy yarn set between China and the UK, will debut this month. "Consider: China has emerged as a global power, yet we do not know how Xi Jinping engineered his rise to the leadership. We barely understand the country's core mechanisms!" he says. "So we spy, to find out. And suddenly you have all sorts of dramatic possibilities." In August, Mai Jia, nicknamed China's John le Carr√©, sees the UK publication of "In the Dark" -- his follow up to his codebreaking and counterespionage novel "Decoded." These are just the latest developments in a wider publishing tale: a growing interest in Asia, and in particular China, as a setting for tales of intrigue.  After the Cold War, writers spent years mourning the loss of old enemies and looking for new ones. They flirted with corporations and took on the Middle East. Yet they struggled to find something that really stuck. "It was easy for le Carr√© and people like that -- they had Russia. They were the obvious enemy," says Paul French, author of murder mystery "Midnight in Peking." Enter China, a former Cold War foe, which remains Communist by name and secretive by nature and it's no surprise that a growing number of acclaimed spy writers are traveling east in search of inspiration. Charles McCarry, one of the U.S.' most respected writers of spy fiction chose China for his 2013 hit: "The Shanghai Factor." It follows a young U.S. agent and his relationship with a mysterious woman named Mei, who is supposedly working for Chinese intelligence. The novel works both as light entertainment and as a more serious metaphor of the increasingly complicated relationship between China and the U.S.  For some, China's characteristic imperviousness is a major obstacle. Can foreign writers get the level of access needed for a great spy novel? "They won't even let foreigners into the Beijing naval museum without a Chinese ID card!" says French. For others, its impenetrable nature is a playground. U.S. journalist Alex Berenson, who set his second spy novel "The Ghost War" on a conflict between the US and China, admitted he left China without a deep understanding of Chinese Communist Party protocol. "Those doors stayed closed to me, as they do to nearly all Westerners," he wrote in the New York Times. "But the opacity that maddens the reporters is manna for novelists, and the novelist in me had a fine time imagining what might be happening behind closed doors in Beijing." China's weird and widely popular workplace novels  Contemporary Chinese writers are catching on too. For Charlotte Middlehurst, books editor at Time Out China, this represents a significant departure from the past. While thrillers, in particular detective stories, have long been popular in China (Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes are big hits), Chinese writers have penned few themselves. "Up until recently the number of foreigners writing spy thrillers set in China has far outweighed that of local writers," Middlehurst says. Not anymore. China now has its own pack-- Xiaolong Qui and He Jiahong for example. "They, along with other writers, most notably Mai Jia, have taken the thriller genre and added Chinese characteristics turning it into something altogether more unique." Middlehurst attributes the trend partly to the rise of social media, which has facilitated online fanzines and reader communities. She also believes President Xi's recent crackdown on corruption "has resonated deeply with readers and authors" as previously off bound topics have become more openly talked about. READ: Profiting from China's banned books  Not all are convinced that China will become literary villain number one though. Spy fiction in the UK and U.S. at least is still dominated by tried-and-tested tropes. Readers like established archetypes. And foreign language books generally struggle to reach these audiences, not least books from or set in China. The culture remains confusing, the history unexplored and the language totally baffling. "When the landscape is so unfamiliar, many readers are wary of plunging into it," says Brookes. "I have tried with "Night Heron" to walk the commercial fiction reader into China and keep them oriented, but it's a hard trick to pull off." "And I think many thriller writers will see renewed strategic rivalries with Russia, the threat of global jihadism and terrorism as more accessible sources of locale and plot," he says. Despite this Brookes is optimistic. "China is the great strategic story of our time, and everybody should be making some effort to get to grips with it," he says. If China doesn't yet have a license to thrill, it's only a matter of time.

            <corpo>Peter Li is a China policy specialist at Humane Society International. He is also an associate professor of East Asian politics, University of Houston-Downtown. The views expressed here are solely his. (CNN)Yulin's dog meat "festival," where some 10,000 dogs are slaughtered and served up as meals, is often wrongly assumed to be an ancient Chinese tradition. In fact, the festival only dates back to 2009 when it was launched in the city in China's southwest to celebrate the summer solstice. The consumption of dog meat does have historical precedence in China. At its height during the Han Dynasty (202 - 220 AD), dog meat was considered a delicacy. Yet, dog eating soon lost favor and by the Sui-Tang dynasties (581 -- 907 AD), dog eating had been rejected as an indecent habit. Subsequent dynasties valued dogs as helpers and hunting buddies. READ: Chinese festival serves up dog meat  In the 21st century, dog eating is facing strong criticism inside China. Three decades of economic expansion has spawned a growing army of animal lovers and pet owners believed to be 30 million strong. Of China's estimated 130 million dogs, at least 27 million are urban pets, according to research group Euromonitor. As more young people move into the cities, they look to companion animals for comfort in the absence of the family unit. With their new found bond with animals, this new generation of Chinese see cats and dogs as thinking, feeling individuals deserving of compassion. Most importantly, they are friends not food. I believe the dog meat industry is fighting a losing battle. My own investigations and those of Chinese activists and journalists all confirm its downward spiral as the cruelty involved is exposed. Guangzhou, a city well known for eating dogs, cats and exotic wildlife, just closed a dog meat restaurant that had been in operation for 51 years, according to local reports. Likewise, brutal dog slaughter used to be everywhere in Beijing's suburbs less than 10 years ago, but it has now virtually disappeared. In 2011, local authorities shut down the Jinghua Dog Meat Festival following nationwide condemnation. How long can Yulin authorities remain defiant of Chinese and international public opinion? READ: The argument for eating dog  The dog meat trade is a serious threat to human health, and Chinese authorities have every reason to stand by the animal advocates. China has the world's second highest incidence of rabies in humans. And according to China's ministry for public health, Guangxi province, where Yulin is located, has the largest number of cases in China, while Yulin is one of China's "top ten cities" for cases of human rabies. READ: Chinese city kills 5,000 dogs to control rabies Eating dog meat of itself does not cause rabies, but the handling and slaughter of vast numbers of unvaccinated dogs exposes the traders to a high risk of rabies infection. Transporting the dogs to the festival is an intrinsically brutal operation. Dogs for Yulin come from as far as central and north China's Henan and Shandong, more than 1,000 miles away. They are crammed into wire cages unable to extend their limbs, denied food and water for days during the exhausting trip. The dogs arrive at their destination malnourished and underweight, dehydrated, often dying from injuries or from being poisoned during capture. Others are already dead.  This isn't solely an animal welfare issue; it's also a food safety disaster. China's food safety regulations ban the processing, selling and serving of products from diseased or dead animals of unknown causes. And yet the Yulin authorities seemingly ignore these rules, allowing dog meat from unknown sources to be sold to consumers, and in so doing prioritizing the profits of dog meat traders over consumer health. When contacted by CNN, a spokesperson for the local food and drug administration declined to answer any questions. The average Chinese citizen finds public dog slaughter inexcusably offensive. Dogs are openly killed in crowded marketplaces, on the streets, and most shockingly next to elementary schools, imposing bloody and cruel practices on vulnerable members of the public. Such public slaughter risks creating an indifferent and morally defunct society. Beating and killing these struggling, crying dogs in full view of other terrified dogs showcases an industry that is devoid of humanity. Additionally, the criminal activity of dog theft sustains much of the dog meat industry, with often violent confrontations between angry dog owners and the thieves.  Opposition to dog eating is not about interfering in the food choices of dog meat eaters, nor a challenge to Chinese culture. No culture is stagnant; it evolves and progresses. During my most recent trip to Yulin in May, I sat down to have tea with five dog meat traders. I asked them if they wanted their children to step into their shoes. They answered a resounding "No." Their children were ashamed of their parents' profession. The 19-year-old son of one trader asked: "Why are you doing this, out of all the jobs out there?" It is a question resounding throughout China, and the authorities need to listen. READ: Smugglers drive Thailand's trade in dog meat  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>China to its drivers: Rein in your road rage - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>New drivers in China must take a course in being "safe and civilized" as authorities attempt to address a rise in road rage.</descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)On the sprawling ground of Beijing Gongjiao Driving School, hundreds of white Volkswagen sedans crawled at a snail's pace as students behind the wheels practiced starting, turning and parking their cars one recent afternoon. "When students become impatient because of the long queue, I tell them to consider this a preview of Beijing's traffic jams," said Geng Guizhi, a veteran instructor at the school, where as many as 10,000 people sign up in a single month. "I tell them, you have to remain calm and patient." That message is more relevant and important than ever, as roads in major Chinese cities become increasingly congested, creating a lot of frustration and anger -- as well as grave danger -- on the streets. Thanks to continued rapid economic growth, government statistics show a 20% jump in private car ownership in 2014 -- to 105 million cars nationwide. The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 200,000 people die on the roads of China every year. From the beginning of 2012 to the end of April this year, police linked 104 million traffic violations to some form of road rage, ranging from forcibly changing lanes or overtaking other vehicles, to failing to yield.  The past few weeks, state media have reported several egregious examples of road rage across China. In early May, a BMW car driven by a young woman collided with a bus in the eastern city of Xuzhou when she tried to change lane. During an ensuing argument, the woman asked two male friends to assault the bus driver -- and then verbally abused traffic policemen upon their arrival. During the same week, a Mercedes-Benz car driver ran over and killed an elderly man in the southwestern city of Kunming, after the driver tried to cut in line at a toll booth and got into an argument with the victim's family. One of the most disturbing incidents was caught on camera on May 3, as a high-speed chase between two cars in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu only ended when the male driver forced the female driver ahead of him to stop under an elevated highway. What happened next shocked and outraged the nation: He dragged her out of the car, threw her to the ground and viciously beat her -- showing no mercy even when she tried to escape.  Public opinion shifted, however, when dashcam footage from the male driver's car emerged. That video, taken before the incident, showed the female driver cutting in front of him at the last second to take a nearly missed highway exit. Many of the woman's sympathizers online turned against her, stirring a national debate on drivers behaving badly and road rage -- with thousands of comments calling reckless driving as appalling as wanton violence. The female driver, who suffered concussion and fractures, has since apologized in an open letter, while the male driver remains behind bars pending a police investigation. "No matter what she did, he should have never resorted to violence," said Liang Di, 28, an office worker in Beijing taking her first driving lesson at the Gongjiao School. "But I also feel the woman driver wasn't blameless -- everything has two sides."  Under the watchful eyes of her instructor, Liang meticulously practiced the steps of starting a manual-shift car. Like the nearly 28 million people who received a new driver's license last year, she also had to sit through a class on how to become a "safe and civilized driver." The class and a mandatory test on the subject are all part of the government's effort to nip the problems of bad drivers and road rage in the bud, as the authorities tighten traffic rules and increase penalties for violators. "Offensive driving caused by road rage is a severe violation of law that disrupts traffic order and endangers safety," said the Ministry of Public Security in a statement after the Chengdu incident. "Drivers should consciously overcome their road rage." Traffic police departments in cities like Beijing even produce nightly television shows that air on local channels, highlighting the potentially deadly consequences of road rage through footage of horrific accidents. Just outside the orderly "streets" of the Beijing driving school one recent evening, the authorities' message appeared to have fallen on deaf ears in the real world as motorists, cyclists and pedestrians fought for space, amid the constant sound of honking and braking. For now, the law of the jungle -- anything goes -- still seems to rule the streets of China, with millions of new cars and news drivers hitting the road every year that may add to the chaos, anger and danger.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Every year, Hong Kong holds the world's largest mass gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But this year will be different.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Tens of thousands of people dressed in black. A sea of candlelight. The roar of pro-democracy anthems sung in Chinese. Every year, Hong Kong holds the world's largest annual mass gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But after sprawling pro-democracy protests put the city at bitter odds with China last fall, this year's anniversary takes on a different meaning. Here's our guide to understanding the significance of June 4 for China and Hong Kong, and what may happen next.  In the spring of 1989, thousands of Chinese students marched into Beijing's Tiananmen Square to call for democracy. Following weeks of peaceful protests, troops acted on the orders of Chinese Communist Party leaders to open fire on civilians and students in the early hours of June 4, ending the mass demonstrations. Though no official figure has been announced, the death toll is estimated to range from several hundred to thousands. Read: Tiananmen Square facts  Chinese censors have blocked the search results of "June 4" and "Tiananmen Square" on the Internet. If mentioned at all in textbooks and campuses, the crackdown is described as an "incident" or a "counterrevolutionary riot" that deserved to be suppressed. Last month, a Chinese student studying abroad penned an open letter, co-signed by 10 other overseas Chinese students, calling for students in mainland China to discuss the Tiananmen Square crackdown. A state-run Chinese newspaper quickly condemned the letter for "twisting the facts of 26 years ago with narratives of some overseas hostile forces."  Every year on June 4, many Hong Kongers hold a massive candlelight vigil in Victoria Park to honor those killed in 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Some mainland Chinese people attend the vigil as well. The vigil is also a expression of fierce discontent with the governments of China and Hong Kong as participants shout political slogans calling for the overthrow of the Chinese Communist Party and the resignation of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed chief executive. In recent years, the crowds have swelled in size as anxiety grows over China's increasing influence in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Last year, the world's first June 4 Memorial Museum opened in Hong Kong.  When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years and eventually develop an election system based on universal suffrage. But nobody agrees on what that actually means. Last year, China proposed letting Hong Kongers vote for their next leader -- as long as candidates are first approved by a small Beijing-backed committee. Infuriated by that proposal, pro-democracy Hong Kongers organized massive street protests that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for 79 days last fall. Those demonstrations -- known as "Occupy" or the "Umbrella Movement" -- were ultimately dispersed by police but deepened rifts in the city and angered Beijing.  Last fall's Occupy movement birthed a new generation of young pro-democracy Hong Kongers who organize on the Internet, refuse to identify as Chinese and are eager for aggressive confrontation. They've lost patience with Hong Kong's older generation of activists, who identify with the movement for democracy in China but have failed to secure tangible democratic gains for Hong Kong. That's why some younger protesters are refusing to attend this year's mass vigil run by the older activists. Some of them see the goal of building a democratic China -- as implied by the remembrance of Tiananmen -- as a distraction from their struggle for democracy in Hong Kong.  In just a few weeks, Hong Kong legislators are expected to vote on the electoral reform proposed by Beijing. But pro-democracy lawmakers have just enough votes to veto the plan, which needs two-thirds majority to pass. Activists have threatened new protests and Beijing has not banned assemblies related to June 4 in Hong Kong. However, local authorities have made it clear that they will not tolerate Occupy-style demonstrations again. Meanwhile, rising housing prices and a growing wealth gap exacerbate discontent among many Hong Kongers. Local and international groups also say press freedom has declined dramatically in the city. No matter the vote's outcome, new confrontations within the increasingly fractured city are all but guaranteed. Distrust runs deep, and nobody has been able to come up with a compromise acceptable to all sides.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Silk 'microchip' heals you from the inside  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Silk may be thousands of years old but in the future it could revolutionize science. We take a look at some alternative uses.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Legend has it silk was discovered by a Chinese empress who was sipping tea under a mulberry tree when a cocoon fell in her cup; the heat unraveling the miraculous material within. Whether or not the fantastic tale is true, more than 5,000 years later silk fabrics have come to signify luxury, elegance, and even seduction. But silk's attributes go beyond mere clothing -- from medicine, to electronics, and household goods, scientists are experimenting with new uses for silk that could shake-up society as we know it. Here are some of the best.  Imagine a thin, centimeter-long square of silk -- a bit like a tiny stamp. This would be the basis of a dissolvable electronic circuit board that could be implanted under the skin, and used to kill infections. "The circuit board is made from magnesium, on a film of silk," explains Fiorenzo Omenetto, Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Tufts University in Massachusetts. "You put it inside an animal that has a bad abscess, you put the little band aid on, and you close it up. Then you turn the device on wirelessly and the resistor inside the animal heats up and the heat kills the infection -- two weeks later the whole device is dissolved."  Not only can silk be reintegrated into the body -- it can be reintegrated into the environment. That means the possibility of crafting biodegradable objects, like a coffee cup, that won't end up in a landfill. "A silk cup can be thrown away without harmful effects to the environment -- unlike a polystyrene cup," says Omenetto. "It's edible, so you can do smart packaging around food and can cook it with the food. It doesn't taste good, so I'm going to need some help with that."  In fact, Omenetto admits that silk "doesn't really taste like anything -- maybe a little bit of the earthy flavor that you smell from the cocoons." But it could be used to preserve other foods. "You could use silk as a stabilizing coating for food -- we are experimenting with thin silk coatings on fruit that prevents them from rotting at room temperature," adds Omenetto. "So in the future you could avoid using other preservatives like waxes."  Much like the healing circuit board under the skin, a silk film could also be used for the basis of an LED tattoo. In this case, tiny silicon chips -- just 250 nanometers thick -- are attached to the silk base, which is molded to the shape of the skin with a saline solution. "We made these implantable light sources where the LEDs light up wirelessly when next to a charging station -- similar to the technology used in wireless hotel entry," says Omenetto. "The electronics are very thin," he says, adding that the research team had already received emails from people requesting the space-age tattoo since they first started experimenting.  One of the most impressive characteristics of silk is its ability to contain other substances -- to literally cocoon them in a case. This means that if you filled it with medicine and implanted it in the body, it could slowly release the medicine inside you. "So imagine you had a screw made of silk that you used to affix bones together -- like a fractured leg," explains Omenetto. "If that screw was filled with medicine, it could be used to deliver drugs at the same time, while your bone is healing."  For the first time, Omenetto's team has now turned silk into a printable inkjet formula -- and the possibilities are endless. "For example, we could print on a latex hospital glove, cover it in silk with these other chemistries, so that when you wear the gloves and touch a contaminated surface it would change color to red," he says. "Or imagine you have a complex cut -- you just take a picture and send it to the printer and print a special bandage with drug distribution that follows the shape of the wound. And this could be done on a desktop computer, like printing a picture." As Omenetto says: "Silk is the fiber that dreams are made of."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Hu Bing: exporting British style to China - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>As its first international style ambassador, Hu will champion British fashion in his homeland and beyond.</descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)It's the final day of men's fashion week in London, and a crowd has gathered inside the Old Sorting Office, a former industrial site, to watch models work the runway. Dylan Jones, the editor of style bible GQ, sits on the front row, just a few seats down from David Gandy, one of the world's most sought-after male models, perhaps most recognized when wearing only a pair of briefs. Yet among the British fashion-savvy, it's a Chinese celebrity who turns the most heads. Wearing golden sneakers and a white suit, Hu Bing carries himself with the confidence and grace you'd expect from China's top male model, who just happens to be a former Olympic rower, a part-time singer and one of China's best-known actors. Hu, now 45, has worked for Cartier, Dunhill, Gucci, and Ferragamo, among others, and now he's working for the British Fashion Council (BFC) ‚Äî the body that promotes British fashion internationally. As its first international style ambassador, Hu will champion British fashion in his homeland and beyond. "The Chinese like British brands, but they don't say 'British fashion,'" he says. "They just say 'European fashion.' Sometimes they mix up London, Paris, and Milan, when the fashion is all totally different." Indeed, Hu has a challenge on his hands. In the most recent World Luxury Index, French and Italian fashion brands, led by Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior and Gucci, dominated the list of the most sought-after luxury fashion labels in China. Burberry was the only British brand in the Top 10. "I need to do a lot of work," Hu says. "I have a responsibility to present London fashion as London fashion." He knows that London has a reputation for the tailoring of Saville Row and the timeless Burberry trench coat, but Hu believes the USP of British fashion comes from its whimsy. "London is more easygoing and more fun," he says. "Designers are more afraid in Asia ‚Äî and in New York and Paris. But in London people really just enjoy themselves. They feel confidant. That is the difference." "I've been to many different cities for Fashion Week ‚Äî Milan, Paris, New York City. But London is the most amazing city for me right now. In five years I want London Fashion Week to be number one."  Like a model balancing in her stilettos, luxury brands in China occasionally wobble. In 2014 the once bullish Chinese luxury market posted its first year of negative growth, shrinking by 1% according to Bain &amp; Co. And in the year leading to April 2015, Prada closed 16 stores in China, while Armani shut five. China's economy may be slowing down, but the British Fashion Council have still made a clever play by drafting Hu as its suited and booted fashion envoy. Despite the broader picture, sales of menswear in China actually climbed 7% last year, according to Euromonitor, and menswear now accounts for a larger chunk of apparel sales than womenswear. Euromonitor forecasts that China ‚Äî currently the fifth largest market for luxury menswear globally ‚Äî will climb to second, behind the United States, by 2017. The number of Chinese press and buyers attending men's fashion week (officially known as London Collections: Men) has nearly doubled since the first showcase in 2012. The market slant towards menswear is driven partly by China's "One-Child Policy" and cultural values that stress the primacy of men over women. Chinese men are increasingly concerned with image and, owing to rising incomes, more likely to trade up the fashion ladder. Hu also sees it as a matter of playing catch-up with China's women. "In China, the lady's closet is almost full," he says. "But men, before they had no clothes, so now they need to buy a lot. They want to dress up and shine."  And when they do, the British Fashion Council is betting that China's men will look to Hu for inspiration. After all: he has 10 million followers on China's microblogging site Weibo. "We are thrilled that Hu Bing has become an International Ambassador for London Collections Men, as his enormous influence, knowledge of the Chinese market and enthusiasm for fashion makes him a perfect choice," Dylan Jones, the chair of LCM, said when announcing the selection earlier this spring. "Having an International Ambassador in China is key to the development of London Collections Men." As part of that development, Hu will educate British fashion houses about the immense and varied Chinese market and counter what he sees as bizarre stereotypes. "I'm here in Europe and I'm surprised that everybody is saying that Chinese people are too serious and not funny," he says. "It's not true. Chinese are interested in new things, and are traveling everywhere in the world." Their bold, international tastes come through in the Chinese designers showing in London. You can't call them pedestrian. Take designer Sean Suen, who, on June 15, sent male models down the runway wearing high-fashion aprons and metallic, open-toed sandals. Hu says that the smartest brands won't try their luck when opening new stores, but will invest the time to conduct longer searches. "You need to know the real China," he says, pointing out that what's "real" changes with the wind. "Every three months you need to update your marketing information. Things happen too fast in China." He also points out that just as fashion varies from London to Paris to Milan, it also varies within China's biggest fashion hubs Shanghai and Beijing. Hu says Shanghai is comparable Tokyo, where people are more likely to keep it simple and conform, while Beijing is akin to anything-goes New York. "In Shanghai, the look is really Japanese. They like to do one thing. It's never four, five, or six. But in Beijing it's like one to ten ‚Äî it's total freedom."   </corpo>

            <descricao>Few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral. Now, fame is posing more risks. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Spectacular, rarely seen images of China's railways - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>From a part-time rail buff to a full-fledged photographer, Wang Wei runs all over China to capture stunning train photos.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)China's rail system is one enormous mass of statistics. It's 120,000 kilometers long (second largest in the world after the United States) and has the highest passenger-per-kilometer ratio in the world -- 1,060 billion passengers in 2013, according to the National Railway Administration of China). But for one Beijing-based "photoworm" -- as photographers are dubbed in China -- it's far more beautiful than a bunch of big numbers. Wang Wei, 25, is possibly the most passionate rail fan in China. Over the past decade he's braved frostbite, unreliable timetables and months away from home while traveling an estimated 300,000 kilometers to capture the country's rail network and its trains in pictures. It's been more than two years since CNN interviewed the then recent university graduate and railway obsessive. Since then, Wang has become a mini-celebrity. He's been interviewed by more than 20 Chinese and overseas media outlets, and even been the subject of a Chinese television documentary. What's more, he has two books being published in China later this year. "Zhui Huo Che" (Running After Trains) is a photo book featuring his experiences and photography techniques. "My Jing-Zhang Railway" is an illustrated book showcasing Wang's photos and interviews with people who have worked and lived on the Beijing-Zhangjiangkou line, China's first Chinese-designed and built railway. "Chinese official have seldom promoted the beauty of the railway and trains," says Wang. "They have never taken pictures of what I've been taken. "Instead, they take photos of leaders delivering a speech, cutting ribbons. "I feel the railway belongs to each of us, everyone has the responsibility to promote it if they love it." CNN: It's been two years since we last talked. Where have you been lately? Wang Wei: The 200-kilometer Southern Xinjiang Railway (Tianshan Mountain section) stopped running in February 2015, so I brought my dad and three friends there last December. It was really cold in Southern Xinjiang in December -- around minus 30C (minus 22F). Even worse, we were told there were wolves in the area and they're very active at night, which was during my shooting times. We decided to dig a hole and burn branches inside. The fire helped us drive away the wolves and warm ourselves. Most important, I got the photos I want. I also visited Japan and Germany in the last two years. CNN: What impressed you the most during the trips? Wang: The railway culture of Japan and Germany moved me a lot. In Germany, they can buy the abandoned rails and trains for cheap, about RMB100,000 ($16,110) for two compartments, which is around one-tenth of the price in China. They (often) retain the original look of their rail cars and turn them into hostels and restaurants. Really lovely. In Japan, when I took photos of the trains, the staff was friendly and gave me useful instructions like where to get the good angles and so on. This is impossible in China. Here the staff will only tell you go away. You can also see quite a number of books featuring railways in Japan. We have very limited materials on railways in China. The length of China's railway system is the second longest in the world, and the history of Chinese railways is more than 100 years old. I really wish the culture of the Chinese railways can catch up. CNN: How did you get into railway photography? Wang: I am a Beijing native and grew up by a train station. I started taking railway photos in 2005 when I was 15. I have a deep connection with the trains and railways. From my window (in my home), I can see trains every day. The first photos I took were of trains at Beijing North Railway Station, which is next to my place. CNN: What's the secret of a good railroad photo? Wang: I usually make a plan two or three days before shooting. According to the train schedule, color and type, I will think about light and background -- should it be directly light or back lit, things like that. It's actually not too complicated. CNN: Which have been your favorites places? Wang: The Greater Khingan Mountains. The Qinghai-Tibet extension rail. South of Xinjiang. And the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's China section. CNN: Any new trends in the train industry you've noticed? Wang: The new high-speed trains are a growing influence everywhere. In my eyes, the new trains aren't as beautiful as old locomotives. However, from a passenger's perspective, it's good to enhance the speed. CNN: What equipment do you use? Wang: A Nikon D800 and a 28-300 VR lens. It usually happens all of a sudden -- the train comes and there's no extra time for me to change lenses so I need a multiple-use, long-haul lens like that. CNN: How do you travel to your destinations? Wang: I use every form of transportation depending on where I go. Trains and cars half of the time, and on foot the other half. During my trip to northeast China in October 2011, I walked more than 186 kilometers in 15 days, not including the mountains I climbed. It was the only way I could reach the places I wanted to go. CNN: How long do your photo expeditions usually take? Wang: Depends where I go -- the journey usually takes from 10 days to a month. The longest journey I took was a 56-day trip covering seven provinces -- Beijing, Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shannxi, Yunnan and Guizhou in the summer of 2011. CNN: Any difficulties during any of your missions? Wang: To me, the difficulties are finding angles and waiting for trains. I love the high angle, so I usually climb mountains to take photos. Some of the mountains are steep and have dangerous wildlife, like snakes. So I need to be very careful. At night, it's even harder to climb. The trains often change schedules according to the weather or other unpredictable reasons, so it's quite normal for me to wait in one spot a whole day without seeing a train. CNN: Is your family supportive? Wang: Like many Chinese parents, they thought I should go to college and get a degree. So at first they didn't support me at all. But when they heard the experiences of my journeys and saw my photos were getting better and better, they were OK with it. My dad sometimes will join me on photo shoots.

            <corpo>(CNN)Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, was moved 3 centimeters (about 1.2 inches) southwest by the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that devastated Nepal in April, Chinese authorities say. But the April 25 quake, which left more than 8,000 people dead, did not affect the height of the 8,848-meter (29,029-foot) mountain, according to the report by China's National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation. Chinese state media reported the administration had set a satellite monitoring system on the peak in 2005 to observe the movement of the mountain. In the decade since, Everest had been moving northeast at a speed of 4 centimeters a year, and had grown by 0.3 centimeters annually, state media reported. The April earthquake reversed the direction of the mountain, shifting it to roughly where it would have been nine months earlier. Nepal reopens 7 historic sites after quakes It triggered a number of avalanches on and around the mountain -- which is at the border of Nepal and China -- claiming the lives of many climbers. The deaths led mountaineering companies to call off their climbs for the rest of the season. Heroes' dreams 'scattered' by quake New data showed a second deadly quake in Nepal, which struck on May 12 with a magnitude of 7.5, did not move the mountain, state media reported. Previous analyses by seismologists have said that the mountain probably shifted by as much as meters in the quake, but the height was probably unchanged.

            <descricao>A dog meat festival in southern China sparks clashes between animal lovers and dog meat eaters. </descricao>
            <corpo>Yulin, Guangxi province, China (CNN)Boss Ning has been running a dog meat restaurant in this southern Chinese city since 1981 and she says business is thriving. Her customers can feast on crispy dog or dog hot pot, as well as lamb, duck and other meats. Dog is particularly popular in the region during the sweltering heat of summer and each June locals and visitors gather for a dog meat eating festival, which this year takes place Monday. "Crispy dogs smell good and taste delicious," she says, declining to give her full name. Her customers seem happy too: "Dog meat is a delicacy. It's nourishing," says one man who gave his name as Huang. But the festival, which sees some 10,000 dogs served up as meals, has become a battlefront in China's nascent animal rights movement. Activists say many of the animals are stolen household pets that are then transported thousands of miles crammed into wire cages and denied food and water. Many arrive at their destination malnourished and diseased, before being slaughtered and served up to customers, they say. Friend or food? Why dog meat trade divides China  A new generation of Chinese animal lovers increasingly view dogs as companions. Of China's estimated 130 million dogs, at least 27 million are urban pets, according to research group Euromonitor. And there are signs that dog meat is losing its popularity in some places. Ten years ago, it was common to see dogs being killed for meat in Beijing's suburbs, says Peter Li, at the Humane Society International. Today, that is something that is rarely seen, he says. And in Guangzhou, a city well-known for its exotic eating habits, a dog meat restaurant that had been in operation for 51 years recently closed. This year, dozens of activists and their pet dogs have descended on Yulin. Some plan to hand in a petition to the local authorities demanding an end to the killing of dogs for food. Others attempted to rescue the animals from the slaughter house. Hao Wei, an animal rights activist who'd traveled hundreds of miles from Xian in northwestern China, said he'd saved five dogs and two cats. "We bought them at the place where the dogs are being killed," he said, adding that he'd spent up to $32 on each animal. "I hope the government would pay more attention to food safety." "The dogs have skin disease and all kinds of other diseases but the butcher says it should be fine once they've been scorched." The festival is also generating outrage internationally, with celebrities like Ricky Gervais calling for it to be stopped.  The clashes between activists and dog meat traders has led to a tense atmosphere at the city's markets where the dogs are traded. A CNN crew was stopped from filming by security officials and stallholders brandishing mops -- one elderly lady wielded a knife. The opposition to the dog meat trade is not just from outsiders. Xie Yanli works in a local cafeteria and says she supports the animal rights activists. "Most of the people who eat it are middle aged men. They eat dogs and drink beer," she said. "I don't eat dogs, I never did and won't do in the future." Liu, a college student from the provincial capital Nanning, said it was his first time to visit the festival. He fears it might be shut down year. "We just wanted to take a look and try things out." Restaurant owners say the publicity the animal rights activists have brought to the city has, perversely, only been good for business. "Originally, people from other provinces across the country didn't know about our dog meat delicacy but after our restaurant was shown on TV, they all come and try it out," says Ning, the restaurant owner. And many in Yulin don't see what the fuss is about. "Eating dog meat is a regular thing for me. Dog rearing is the same as rearing pigs or chickens, there is no difference," said a man who gave his name as Zhong, who was enjoying dog hot pot with a friend.  </corpo>

            <descricao>In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>China: Young people seek out no-frills weddings - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>With the average Chinese wedding now costing $20,000, some couples are looking for cheaper alternatives. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Shiny rings, white gowns and luxury cars filled the mammoth national convention center, next to the Chinese capital's Olympic Bird's Nest stadium, one recent weekend. Armed with balloons, teddy bears and goody bags filled with coupons, throngs of salespeople stood outside their booths, shoving free gifts into the hands of visitors in an attempt to turn them into clients. Spread across two floors, more than 200 vendors competed at Beijing's Olympic-sized wedding expo for the attention -- and, more importantly, the wallets -- of thousands of young couples. PHOTOS: Tibetan couple's unconventional wedding pictures go viral  Everything was on sale at a discount, but even a rough calculation on site pointed to the soaring cost of getting married in China. The total bill could easily exceed $20,000 -- an unimaginable sum just a few years ago -- counting a pair of rings, a bridal gown, a banquet, a photo shoot and a professional planner. In the United States, the average cost of a wedding -- excluding a honeymoon -- has a similar price tag of $25,200, according to the latest figure released by the Wedding Report, a market research firm. Although rapid economic growth has brought rising incomes, the average Chinese still makes only a fraction of their American counterpart. Government statistics show the annual disposable income for 2014 was only $3,283 per person in China. The ballooning cost of weddings has spurred a multi-billion-dollar industry, but also put a heavy burden on the more than 10 million couples marrying every year in the world's most populous nation, especially those who already feel financially strained trying to buy their first home and car. READ: How to get ahead on China's dating scene Faced with a deep-rooted cultural preference for marriage, however, young Chinese preparing to tie the knot admit that cutting back is not always an option. "It's a once-in-a-lifetime event -- so I have to show my commitment to her and her parents through the wedding," explained Wang Di, 23, who was looking for good deals at the expo even though he and his girlfriend don't plan to walk down the aisle for another two years. "We may not care that much about the ceremony -- but the parents and other relatives do."  Frustrated with family pressure, some rebellious Chinese couples have chosen to enter so-called "naked marriages" with no houses, no cars, no weddings -- and sometimes no rings. While the public seems to appreciate the philosophy of true love trumping everything else, most respondents in repeated surveys still reject the notion of disavowing all traditional trappings of marriage. Increasingly, though, less radical -- but more creative and affordable -- ideas are gaining popularity in big cities. At a courtyard house in suburban Beijing one recent Saturday, the dress code was casual, but everyone appeared to be having some serious fun at the bride and groom's "do-it-yourself" wedding. On stage, the bride had already kicked off her high-heels. The venue was the couple's home -- rented for only $2,500 a year from a local farmer. The decoration that emphasized fresh flowers and entertainment -- featuring a DJ and a band -- were both courtesy of their artistic friends. Adorning the brick walls were various home-made movie-style posters starring the bride and groom, including one showing them laughing in bed with the phrase "mad love" in bold yellow lettering splashed across the red duvet covering their bodies. READ: Glut of women at Shanghai's marriage market  "Almost every wedding now goes through the same drill and I don't want that," said bride Zhang Yueyue, a marketing manager at an arts magazine. "I think letting everyone have fun is the most important thing. Many Chinese weddings now are more about flaunting wealth and letting parents have 'face' through extravagance." Counting catering and tailor-made traditional Chinese dresses, Zhang and her artist husband spent less than $2,000 on their big day. With their modest incomes, the newlyweds agreed that saving from the wedding meant more money to start their married life together. Amid loud cheers and applause in the courtyard, some of the couple's guests already felt inspired. "My budget won't be high either," said Zhao Mengsha, a colleague and friend of the bride who is planning her own summer wedding. "I just want a big party with some entertainment -- and most importantly lots of alcohol." That definitely sounds like a winning formula for a special occasion.

            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)At the height of his power, Zhou Yongkang controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and the domestic security czar wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." Before retiring in 2012, Zhou saw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the 2 million-strong Chinese military -- the world's largest. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Away from the spotlight, though, Zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth. The allegedly blatant exchange between money and power, as revealed by China's state media, would eventually prompt Zhou's shocking downfall. He's the most senior official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic of China.  After months of intense political rumors, the Communist Party's disciplinary arm in July announced a formal investigation into Zhou for "serious disciplinary violations." In December, state-run Xinhua news agency reported his arrest after the Communist leadership expelled him from the party. And in April, state prosecutors revealed he had been formally charged with accepting bribes, abuse of power and leaking state secrets. After a criminal trial held in Tianjin, a city near Beijing, he was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes. Zhou, 72, also received seven years for abusing power and four years for deliberately revealing state secrets. Party investigators also accused Zhou of having affairs with multiple women, and trading power and money for sex. Read: China announces investigation into security czar  Many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign ostensibly targeting "tigers and flies" -- high-ranking and low-level officials alike. "The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members," said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Unlike Xi, who is "Communist royalty" thanks to his father's status as one of Mao Zedong's comrades in arms during the revolution, Zhou was born to a poor family in eastern China. His father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school. Smart and hardworking, Zhou didn't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in Beijing. That school, now called China University of Petroleum, was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry. After graduating with a degree in oil exploration, Zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. Described by many as a capable and humble young party cadre, Zhou was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge. His political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in Beijing, which later became a giant state-owned oil company and one of Zhou's power bases. Read: In China, 'everyone is guilty of corruption'  Overcoming factional wars in the ministry, Zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects, a two-pronged strategy that would continue to this day. Fast growth of business abroad made supervision from Beijing harder, sowing the seeds for corruption. In 2001, after a stint as minister of land resources, Zhou was named the Communist Party chief of Sichuan, one of the country's most populous provinces. State media there portrayed Zhou as an eloquent leader with a clear vision, and gave him credit for luring high-tech companies, including Intel, to the southwestern province as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors. Zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from Beijing -- in key postings throughout the province. Zhou's big break came in 2002 when he returned to Beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security, which runs the country's police forces. Five years later, he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the Politburo Standing Committee -- with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs. His reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 60th anniversary of the Communist rule in 2009 and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010.  As the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else, Zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already-limited judicial independence, cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists. It was also during this period that Zhou became a patron of Bo Xilai, a fast-rising political star who was waging a controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing. Bo's spectacular downfall in 2012 -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. Read: Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal Bo supporters, however, have long called him a political victim as the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political activists and observers now note the similarity between the Bo and Zhou cases. "Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs," said Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on "subversion" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement. "The bottom line is: All officials are corrupt," he added. "Xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption -- something that helps him win the masses' hearts and minds." Lam, the Hong Kong analyst, said. "The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles. People who are close to Xi are less liable to becoming incriminated."  Those close to Zhou have fallen with him. State media have reported official investigations -- and formal arrests in some cases -- of dozens of Zhou's family members and former aides. The biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Details have also emerged in Chinese media about possible skeletons in Zhou's closet, including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife. Most stories, though, have focused on the vast wealth amassed by Zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families. The Zhous reportedly benefited immensely from China's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to Zhou's deep ties to the two related ministries. Zhou's older son, who is 42, is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars. Before turning 30, the younger Zhou had quick success in business after winning a contract to upgrade IT systems for 8,000 gas stations across China. His companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations. State media reports also indicated that one of Zhou's younger brothers, a onetime farmer, used Zhou's influence to launch a "crisis management" business and profited from helping people get out of jail, enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state-owned oil fields. Other published articles have depicted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure. "I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved," analyst Lam said. "His only incentive now is to protect his son -- he will toe the line to protect his son." Read: Is China's corruption crackdown really a political purge?  </corpo>

            <descricao>A new robot, designed to emotionally interact with humans, sold out within a minute of its consumer release on Saturday. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Pepper the humanoid robot is so hot that he sold out within a minute, according to his Japanese creator, SoftBank Robotics Corp. Only 1,000 models were available for the consumer launch on Saturday in Japan. The base price was set at ¬•198,000 ($1,600) with an additional ¬•24,600 ($200) monthly data and insurance fees.  Standing just under four feet tall, and weighing 61 pounds, Pepper is designed to read emotions as well as recognize tones of voice and facial expressions in order to interact with humans. But most of all, "he tries to make you happy," Kaname Hayashi, Softbank's project manager, told CNN last year. With his array of cameras, touch sensors, accelerometer and other sensors in his "endocrine-type multi-layer neural network," Pepper has the ability to read your emotions as well as develop his own. He isn't a work robot, but more of an emotional companion for people. Pepper has his own evolving emotions which "are influenced by people's facial expressions and words, as well as his surroundings," according to SoftBank. "Pepper is at ease when he is with people he knows, happy when praised and scared when the lights go down." Developers admit that the robot may make mistakes, but says Pepper will learn and grow over time through his own emotional engine and collective wisdom gained through collected cloud data. Pepper currently has the ability to speak English, French, Japanese and Spanish. In the next few months, there will be more language releases in its app store, which already has around 200 apps.  Two days prior to Peppers initial limited release, SoftBank announced a new partnership with the Apple manufacturer Foxconn and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which each agreed to invest ¬•14.5 billion (over $118 million) for 20 percent shares in SoftBank Robotics Holding. SoftBank envisions Pepper as a first step in spreading robotics worldwide. Softbank is willing to sell Pepper at a loss for the first four years, but expect the robot to bring in profits by the fifth year and become a major force in revenues 20 to 30 years in the future. Company officials stated that they want to keep Pepper affordable, and compared the price of the robot to that of a pet dog in Japan, according to a press event held last week. SoftBank also plans to launch "Pepper for Biz" in the fall, making the robot available for businesses and will announce details in July. Pepper has already been used to sell Nestle coffee machines in Japanese stores. Interested in buying your own Pepper robot? SoftBank will be releasing information about additional sales on their website in July.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Washington (CNN)This week more than 400 Chinese officials are descending on Washington for three days of political, security and economic talks. The countries top diplomats and finance officials are gathering for the annual U.S.-China strategic and economic dialogue, viewed as an important forum managing ties between the world's two leading economies. The breadth of the talks, now entering their seventh year, reflects efforts to deepen and strengthen ties between the global powers. But this year's dialogue is clouded by mistrust and heightened tensions over China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and suspicions Beijing was behind a massive hack on U.S. government computers in which millions of personnel files were stolen. RELATED: 5 awkward conversations for Ash Carter and Chinese general Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China's executive vice foreign minister, Zhang Yesui, led talks between civilian and military officials on Monday to discuss security issues. On Monday night, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew are hosting China's State Councilor Yang Jiechi and Vice Premier Wang Yang for a private dinner, before the two days of talks of political and economic talks officially kick off on Tuesday. A senior State Department official briefing reporters said Monday's discussions were already "candid and to the point" and that the aim of the security discussions was to "really try to get at those issues which are the most likely to drive strategic mistrust between the U.S. and China." "The talks are all the more important for the need to address these issues head on, not try to paper them over, not try to agree to disagree," the official said. "But to try to actually talk about them, and see if we can in particular kind of try to narrow the differences but certainly at least make sure that we're communicating clearly on the areas of difference so that we don't miscalculate, misunderstand, etc." Both sides are emphasizing areas of cooperation between the two countries, like diplomacy on North Korea and a nuclear deal with Iran, climate change, Afghanistan and fighting the Ebola virus. "We have agreed with the Chinese that we are going to try to expand those areas where our interests overlap and expand cooperation in those areas," the senior State Department official said. But the official insisted the discussions will be "candid and to the point" and they will not "paper over" differences related to the South China Sea and cybersecurity. "What we're trying to do is to show that we can effectively manage areas of ongoing differences and work to narrow those differences over time," the official said. Danny Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia, set the scene for the talks on Thursday, saying a direct approach was best. "We don't turn a blind eye to problems. We discuss them and we seek to tackle them directly," he said. "We don't always see eye-to-eye but the fact is global challenges require that we cooperate." The scale of Chinese building and militarization of man-made islands in the South China Sea has raised concern in the region about Beijing's territorial ambitions. Last month the U.S. flew a rare and highly publicized military surveillance flight in the area to highlight the massive scale of activity. China calls the islands its sovereign territory, but the U.S. has said China is building in disputed waters and is threatening freedom of navigation in sea lanes which are key for international trade. Russel called last week's announcement by China that it planned to continue and expand construction on reclaimed outposts "troubling." "Neither that statement, nor that behavior, contributes to reducing tensions," Russel said. "We consistently urge China to cease reclamation to not construct further facilities and certainly not to further it." The already tense relationship between the U.S. and China over cybersecurity has recently become more fraught after the Chinese suspended a separate track of talks to discuss the issue a year ago when the U.S. charged five Chinese military officers with hacking. Although the cyber working group has not met since, Russel and other U.S. officials have said cybersecurity would be raised throughout the talks, both from a security context and an economic one. RELATED: Obama's troubled trade agenda may get new life "Certainly the issue will be addressed in pretty direct terms with the Chinese," the senior State Department official said Monday. The talks area as much about U.S.-China financial ties as political ones, and take place against the backdrop of China's growing economic influence across Asia. Questions about U.S. economic leadership in the region come on the heels of Congress' rejection of fast-track trade authority for President Barack Obama's landmark Asia-Pacific trade deal. Progress toward a bilateral investment treaty between the two countries has also been slow. Both sides have an interest in reducing tensions ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the White House in December, his first since taking office two years ago. China's state-run Xinhua news agency on Friday quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as saying talks are an opportunity to "push for a new model of major power relationship." The Chinese story said climate change would be a "hot topic" at the upcoming dialogue, but did not mention cybersecurity or the South China Sea.  </corpo>

            <descricao>A record-breaking heat wave baked Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, over the weekend, killing 323 people to date.</descricao>
            <corpo>Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Hundreds of people have died in a three-day heatwave affecting Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, according to local media reports. A spokesperson from the Sindh province Ministry of Health told CNN that 323 people had died in Karachi as a result of the heatwave. The ministry also told CNN that the number of patients treated for heat stroke in Jinnah hospital, the largest in the city, is 2.360. Others, unable to make it to a hospital, may have died at home. At least one city morgue, CNN affiliate Geo.tv has reported, has been overwhelmed with the numbers of dead. Death tolls in local media reports vary. The Sindh provincial government has declared a state of emergency in all its government hospitals, canceling leave of medical personnel and bringing in further medical supplies. The record-breaking temperatures would likely bring more deaths before cooler weather, forecast for later in the week, arrive. Saturday's temperature reached 44.8 degrees Celsius (112.64 degrees Fahrenheit) -- the highest-recorded temperature in Pakistan in the last 15 years. Sunday's temperature dipped slightly to 42.5 Celsius (108.5 F).  Citizens in this predominantly Muslim country are observing Ramadan, the holy month when Muslim faithful around the world fast from sunup until sundown. This means, that amidst these scorching temperatures, Pakistanis are foregoing food and water. Making matters worse, Karachi is dealing with frequent power outages as the electricity grids are unable to keep up with the demand in the city of 20 million. To the east, a heat wave struck India last month, killing more than 2,000 people. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad; Ralph Ellis wrote from Atlanta. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met with the country's first female fighter jet pilots, calling them "heroes of Korea" and "flowers of the sky." Pilots Jo Kum Hyang and Rim Sol wept as they were presented with bouquets in front of their leader, who attributed their successful solo flights to their "noble revolutionary spirit, ideological acceptance of the party's training-first policy and loyalty to the Supreme Commander," KCNA, North Korea's state news agency reported. Kim watched on as they performed take-off and landing drills. It was not clear exactly when they took place. State media has been praising the prowess of the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) in recent months, but the planes on the airfield told a different story. The pilots were flying what appeared to be Soviet era MiG-21 supersonic fighter jets or a Chinese version of that aircraft -- the Chengdu J-7 supersonic fighter jet. The MiG-21 first came into service in the late 1950s and saw considerable service in the Vietnam War. The KPAF is estimated to be the fifth-largest air force in the world, with 110,000 service personnel and 820 combat aircraft. But there is considerable doubt as to how many of those aircraft, some of them dating back to the 1950s, are airworthy. Visitors to Pyongyang are often surprised by the sight of antiquated biplanes on the runway. North Korea's most advanced combat aircraft, nearly three dozen MiG-29's, were purchased from the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. A lack of fuel, spare parts and the need to conserve the aging fleet mean pilots can log only a handful of flying hours a year. However, that does not seem to discourage Jo Kum Hyang and Rim Sol. KCNA reported that they tearfully thanked Kim "for giving them wings to fly and courage." They pledged themselves to fly "in the aerial front line, to safeguard Kim Jong Un through a thousand miles of clouds and ten thousand miles of fire." Journalist Han Sol contributed to this report </corpo>

            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)An electric taxi has taken to the streets of Singapore in a bid to make the already green city more eco-friendly -- and it's tailored to the tropics. The taxi -- named EVA -- can recharge its battery in 15 minutes and cover a distance up to 200 kilometers when fully charged. "Taxi drivers can now quickly recharge for the next part of their shifts during a break," say the creators TUM create -- a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Germany's Technische Universitat M√ºnchen -- on their website. According to TUM Create, taxis make up less than 3% of the vehicle population in Singapore, yet account for 15% of the total distance covered by all vehicles in Singapore, making the move towards electricity more appealing, particularly when the country's hot climate is accounted for.  With temperatures averaging above 30 degrees Celsius throughout the year, the need to keep passengers comfortable is a crucial factor when designing a vehicle in Singapore. EVA provides this -- whilst maintaining energy efficiency -- through overhead air conditioning to cool individual seats. "If you like it more hot and I like it more cold...we can change that," says Felix Roemer, Research Associate with TUM Create. With the cooling system placed overhead the cool air drops down -- improving efficiency. The taxi's seats have also been designed to draw moisture away from the body as people sit on them to help reduce reliance on air conditioning. It wouldn't be Singapore without some aspect of smart technology. This has been incorporated through a smartphone app, which passengers can use to hail a taxi, control its air conditioning and entertainment, and then pay. But despite these advances, the challenge of adequate charging stations remains. "Even the fastest charges that are available right not, they're not capable to deliver these high powers and currents," says Roemer, but he is confident Singapore will get up to speed to make the taxis more usable.  The release of EVA is in line with Singapore's overall move towards green transport to both reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate impact on climate change. The nation's future engineers are also stepping in to pave the way with a 3D printed solar car -- designed for the 2015 Shell Eco-marathon Asia (SEMA), which took place in February. The NV-8, designed by students at Nanyang Technical University, is made-up of 150 parts printed in plastic to make-up the body of the car to then combine with a carbon-fiber base to produce an ulta-light car weighing just 120 kilos -- rivaling other eco-cars. "It's like a project of love really," says Professor Ng Heong Wah who mentored the team. But Ng knows the design has its limits, as the parts took three months to complete printing for the final model. "Faster, bigger, cheaper, more different kinds of materials," says Ng acknowledging current factors holding back the cars prosperity. "If you overcome these four obstacles I think it can be done," he says. Ng also mentored a team behind the University's second entry into the eco-marathon -- the NV9 -- made of carbon fibre composite, polycarbonate and aluminium combined with a solar panel on its canopy to partly power the car, which went on to win awards for technical innovation and safety in the competition.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Japan shakes off 67-year ban on dancing after midnight  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Since 1948, Japan's dance culture has been forced to hide in the shadows due to a law that forbade dancing after midnight. That's now set to change.</descricao>
            <corpo>Tokyo (CNN)On a recent Friday night, a small band of street performers breaks into an impromptu hip hop show near Shibuya crossing, one of the world's busiest intersections. A crowd quickly gathers, many begin tapping their toes, shaking their hips, and waving their arms to the beat. This kind of dancing in the streets is permitted in a vibrant, youthful place like Shibuya. Yet, just a few minutes walk down the street, behind a nondescript glass entrance and down a flight of stairs, that same kind of dancing could get you thrown in jail. The reason? It's happening in a club. SEE: World street dance styles  A few hours later, there's a line of young people waiting at the entrance of Sound Museum Vision. It's almost 2 a.m. Things are just getting started and the patrons seem eager to pay the cover charge, get inside, and be consumed by the booming music below. Aside from its physical location beneath the streets of Tokyo, the dance club has an underground feel. That's because Japan's entire dance culture has been forced to hide in the shadows amid stepped-up enforcement of a law from 1948 that forbids dancing after midnight or 1 a.m. in bars, clubs, and most other public venues. Last week, Japanese lawmakers voted to lift the notorious dancing ban, which goes back to the American occupation after World War II. Back then, "dance halls" were often a front for prostitution, which was rampant at the time in the poverty-stricken nation. Times have changed. Japan is now one of the world's largest economies with a high standard of living and vibrant nightlife. Opponents of the dancing ban call it obsolete and oppressive. The law sat in the books collecting dust, and police looked the other way for decades, allowing Japan's dance scene to thrive in the 70s, 80s and 90s. But a string of high profile drug cases involving celebrities, and a deadly club brawl in 2010 in Osaka that killed a 22-year-old student, led to a surge of arrests from club raids.  In what became known as "Japan's War on Dance," police used the no dancing laws to arrest DJs and haul club patrons to police stations, where they were often tested for drugs. The new law says club seating areas can't be too dark, which is an attempt to discourage crime. They need to be lit more than 10 lux, similar to a movie theater with the lights on. Darker clubs will be governed under the old law and will have stricter rules for after-midnight operation. Until changes take effect next year, after hours dancing is still against the law. "It's crazy. Don't make any sense. It's a dance club," says musician and dancer David Escoe. "But I still get down. I'm usually in VIP. The key is you have to know the owner." Many Japanese bars and nightclubs put up "no dancing" signs, which are often a shock to first-time visitors to Japan. The signs are an attempt to avoid problems with police, who consider dance clubs magnets for violence, drug abuse, and sex crimes. Daizo Murata, the owner of Sound Museum VISION and other Tokyo clubs, says he spent 21 days in jail for violating Japan's dancing ban and has operated in constant fear of police raids for years. "I worry about it every day. I've been worrying for 30 years," Murata says.  Murata is part of a movement demanding change. A high profile raid and arrest at the Osaka club "NOON" in 2012 sparked the movement involving a wide range of club supporters, encompassing not only musicians and DJs, but also lawyers and politicians. The Let's Dance Petition Committee, initiated by world-known musician Ryuichi Sakamoto and others, gathered more than 150,000 signatures urging lawmakers to abolish the dancing ban in 2013. The non-partisan parliamentarians league was formed to submit the revision to the parliament in 2014. The draft was modified by the police and government before being ratified last week. There is political will to push the law through quickly. Heading toward the 2020 Olympic Games, many feel Tokyo cannot simply remain a city that goes dark after midnight. Politicians from various parties have pushed to lift the ban. In Tokyo, around 50 clubs and 300 DJ's are forming a Dance Entertainment Association (DEA) and plan to collaborate for events and discuss issues like club safety and security. "Now, the artists and DJs will be able work safely," Murata says. "More great artists will be able to come here." Many supporters of the club culture say "Japan's War on Dance" is finally over. The victory dance will keep going long after the clock strikes midnight.  </corpo>

            <descricao>A new book entitled Fashion China provides an introduction to 41 of the country's most exciting designers.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The obsession of Chinese luxury shoppers with Western brands is old news. Now, a new book entitled Fashion China is turning the spotlight on the top local brands vying for the international spotlight. Written by Irish fashion curator Gemma A. Williams, the book provides an introduction to 41 of the country's most exciting designers, from Fashion Fringe award-winner Haizhen Wang to couturier Laurence Xu. "We're creating a snapshot of what is going on over there," says Williams. "Designers play by their own rules, and it creates such an interesting dynamic." The author, who sports Alexander McQueen and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in her resume, was initially inspired by the growing number of Chinese international students she encountered while working at the London College of Fashion's Fashion Space Gallery in 2013.  To find the most interesting designers, Williams brought together a panel of Chinese experts, including Liu Wen -- widely considered the first Chinese supermodel -- and Karchun Leung, editor of Num√©ro China. "I'm going over with Western eyes and trying to understand the industry in terms of our systems, which has been the base for 100 years at least," she says. "Collaboration with [the panel] really opened my eyes to how unique the industry was." These differences include a unique design history and tradition, as well as a less strict adherence to the fashion calendar model that dominates in the West. (China has two major fashion weeks -- Beijing and Shanghai -- with irregular rosters, and many high profile designers show off-schedule or abroad.) "They helped me realize that the same criteria will never apply to the Chinese market. It's too large and it's too new, so they can set their own benchmarks."  By profiling a range of designers, Fashion China dispels common misconceptions and stereotypes about what Chinese fashion means. Designers like Guo Pei, who creates lavish, architectural couture gowns in Beijing, prove that 'Made in China' needn't mean shoddy quality; and the international buzz behind London-based newcomer Ryan Lo's colorful kitsch shows that Chinese design doesn't have to be traditional. But Williams thinks it could be a while before a Chinese designer becomes a household name abroad. Because of the diversity and breadth of their aesthetics, she doubts there will be a unified rise to prominence similar to that of avant garde Japanese designers like Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Gar√ßons creator Rei Kawakubo in the 1970's and 80's. "Chinese fashion is so varied and so disparate that it's very hard to pick out one or two aesthetics ... It's not like Japan, where they had a unified aesthetic that became a very strong look," she says. However, Williams hopes the book will encourage Westerners to shop outside their comfort zones, and recognize the value of work being done outside of the fashion capitals. "My main goal is to promote," she says. "It's really exciting that people are talking about these brands and finding out about them, and I hope [Fashion China] opens up the discourse around Chinese fashion." Fashion China is published by Thames &amp; Hudson.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>The girl in the photo from Vietnam War - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>An iconic photo from the Vietnam War captured Kim Phuc in a little girl's moment of agony. Now she has learned to forgive.</descricao>
            <corpo>This is the first in an occasional series called "Rewind: Where are they now?" It catches up with people who stumbled into the headlines -- and then faded from view. Also, tune in at 9 p.m. ET Thursday June 25 for an episode of "The Seventies" that focuses largely on the Vietnam War. Ajax, Ontario, Canada (CNN)Even without the benefit of context, the image of a naked 9-year-old girl running for her life is as searing and indelible today as it was 43 years ago. That image jolted people around the world. Some say it hastened the end of the Vietnam War. "I always remember that horrible day that we ran from life to death," says Kim Phuc, the girl in that iconic photo. Now 52, she lives just outside Toronto, a wife, mother and survivor inextricably linked to a photograph that dominated front pages in 1972, seven months before the signing of Paris Peace Accords led to the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from South Vietnam. In the beginning, says Phuc, she hated the photo. It embarrassed her. And she struggled with the publicity that surrounded it. For her. it was personal: It captured a moment of torment -- her face frozen in an agonizing wail moments after a napalm attack burned and disfigured her for life. In fact, no one would blame Phuc if she had tried to get as far away from the image as possible. But that is not what she did. After a long struggle, Phuc came to realize that if her pain and terror had not been captured on film that day, the bombing -- like so many other wartime horrors -- might have been lost to history. She began to think about what the photograph could give, rather than what it could take away. Eventually, the photo became much more than a depiction of a moment in time to Phuc -- it became what she calls "a path to peace." "I realized that if I couldn't escape that picture, I wanted to go back to work with that picture for peace. And that is my choice." 'I can work with that picture for peace' It's hard to square the anguish and terror of the girl in the picture with the warm, relaxed, engaging presence that is Kim Phuc today. Besides being a loving wife and mother, she is a mentor, and a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations. Every year she travels the world to recount her story of survival, to raise awareness about the brutality of war. In addition to her work with the U.N., Phuc started the Kim Foundation International, a charity that helps children suffering from war, just as she did so many years ago. Its mission is to help the most underprivileged children suffering from war -- building hospitals, schools and homes for children who have been orphaned. Phuc says she plans to live out her life in service of that mission. "That's why I'm really thankful that I had that picture taken and I can work with that picture for peace." Phuc and her husband claimed asylum in Canada more than 20 years ago and have raised two boys there. Phuc says she is very happy in her "second home" and gratified that her parents have been able to join her in Canada. Now, says Phuc, that terrified little girl in the picture is "not running anymore. She's flying." It was not always so. 'I saw a girl, naked ... running' In 1972 Phuc lived in the village of Trang Bang, north of Saigon. She and family were sheltering in a temple when they heard planes overhead. Afraid they would be bombed, they ran outside to find safety, just as bombs detonated all around the temple. The bombs delivered napalm, a flammable liquid that clings to human skin, causing horrific burns when ignited. Phuc remembers intense heat and excruciating pain. She pulled burning clothes from her body. She ran. Moments later, a young Associated Press photojournalist took the photograph of his life. Nick Ut was only 21 years old and already a seasoned war photographer when he arrived at that South Vietnamese village. "I looked through the black smoke and I saw a girl, naked ... running," Ut told CNN this year. Instinct took over. He started taking pictures as Phuc and the other children ran straight for him. As Phuc approached, Ut saw parts of her skin falling off. She had torn off her clothes to stop the burning. The napalm already had seared her neck, most of her back, and her left arm. "I said: 'Oh my God I don't believe she's burned so badly,'" Ut recalled. "I put my camera down on the highway and tried to help her." He poured water on her wounds and covered her with a coat. He picked up Kim and the other children and put them in his van to get them to a hospital. "Inside my van she said, 'I'm dying, I'm dying.' I kept watching her every minute. I said, 'We will be there soon.'" 'I learned to forgive' Phuc spent more than a year in hospitals. Her family feared she would never survive. She underwent countless painful skin grafts and other surgeries and eventually recovered from her physical wounds. Yet she could not find peace. She wanted to disappear. She even wished for death. She thought if she died she wouldn't have to suffer mentally, physically and emotionally. She began to seek answers, studying different religious texts. At 19, she became a Christian, and she credits her faith for helping her embrace life again. "When I became Christian, I have a wonderful connection -- the relationship between me, and Jesus, and God." Phuc says she prayed for help: She wanted to move on. She wanted to have kids. "And from that point," she says, "I learned to forgive." Now Phuc radiates an unmistakeable poise and peace when she tells her story. She says she sees that famous picture as just one of many blessings. "I really want to thank God that he spared my life when I was a little girl," she says. "Whatever happened to me, I have another opportunity to be alive, to be healthful, to be a blessing, to help honor other people."  </corpo>

            <descricao>This isn't kid's stuff. These are 5 of the best animations from around the world, as chosen by the director of the prestigious Annecy Film Festival. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The world of animation isn't all child's play. Savage deaths, troubling dreams, and passionate relationships are just some of the topics covered in these beguiling films created by highly-skilled hands. We asked the artistic director of the prestigious Annecy International Animated Film Festival in France, Marcel Jean, to pick out the best nominated short films from the event, which runs from June 15 to 20. Hailing from across the world, the surreal movies were made with everything from clay, to illustration, and cut-out papers. Here are five of our favorites.  This Estonian film, which bears the English title "House of Unconsciousness" is a surreal imagining of the dreams of chimney sweepers. Director Priit Tender used a study on dreams as the basis of his surreal 10 minute piece which explores the most frequent images chimney sweepers dream about -- from women on fire to giant seals.  This eight-minute pixilation tells the story of two lovers who are struggling to cope after their relationships ends. They divide the city into two and Duarte tries to remove memories of Amelia from his life by cutting her name out of his vast book collection. Meanwhile, Amelia boils down her memories of Duarte into cold chemical equations.  Alessandro Novelli used the parable "Before the Law" from Franz Kafka's book "The Trial" as inspiration for this mindful piece. Here, a peasant stands in front of a gate guarded by a fearsome guardian who denies him entrance. When the film showed at the Arizona International Film Festivals, Novelli commented said of piece: "Sometimes we don't have the strength to take decisions and live our lives how we want."   Guida has been working as an archivist for 30 years when one day she sees a newspaper ad looking for models for a life drawing class. She re-finds her beauty, creativity and inner child through the experience as the film asks us to rethink what beauty is really about.  Two cosmonauts, who have been friends since birth, go through rigorous training to achieve their dream of traveling in space. This animated short by Konstantin Bronzit shows us just how important friendship is.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Art Basel Hong Kong's eerily realistic nude sculpture  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>What kind of model could pose nude in a gallery 24-hours-a-day? Answer: The fake kind. Welcome to Art Basel, one of Hong Kong's biggest art fairs.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)A crowd of people jostle for a closer look at the naked woman crouching on her knees. Phones held aloft, the group shamelessly take pictures of her bare back and bottom -- safe in the knowledge she won't be waking up anytime soon. The remarkably life-like nude sculpture, created by Australian artist Sam Jinks, was by far the most photographed work at this year's Art Basel in Hong Kong, a three-day art fair that has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since it first launched nearly three years ago. A powerhouse brand in the art fair industry, Art Basel bought-out the homegrown Hong Kong International Art Fair in 2011, and quickly cemented the city's position in the multi-billion dollar global art market. This year's fair brought together 233 galleries from 37 countries and territories. Half of the galleries are from the Asian region, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. "It's a one-stop shop," is how Art Basel in Hong Kong director, Asia Adeline Ooi, describes the blockbuster show. "We have the best of Asia and the best of the rest of the world in the room." Just across from Jink's hyper-real nude model is Japanese art superstar Takashi Murakami's Kaikai KiKi booth, filled with statement works from the anime-inspired Superflat movement. Along with the hugely popular nude model, Jinks also created this sculpture from silicone, resin and human hair. Nearby is the booth for Hong Kong-based French dealer, Edouard Malingue, who shows established European names such as Laurent Grasso, alongside local up-and-comers -- most notably Jo√£o Vasco Paiva, who displayed a nearly six-meter-tall sculpture resembling Styrofoam boxes typically found on the streets of Hong Kong. The emphasis on regional representation is what makes the fair stand out from its two counterparts, Art Basel in Basel, and Art Basel in Miami, and from the 180 other major international art fairs that take place throughout the year. While people from all walks of life come to ogle the art, and flocks of excitable school children are herded through, nattily dressed gallerists are quietly sealing million-dollar deals. A Chris Ofili painting titled "Dead Monkey - Sex, Money and Drugs," was sold for $2 million at David Zwirner's booth within the first hour of the fair's VIP preview on March 13. Art Basel in Hong Kong moved from its original May dates to March 15-17 this year, coinciding with the Hong Kong Arts Festival and the International Film Festival. The Hong Kong Tourism Board has dubbed March the "Hong Kong Arts Month." Art fervor has spilled beyond the art sector and even the city's shopping malls are filled with grand installations to coincide with the fair. It is also the first year of satellite art fair, Art Central, created by the same founders of the original Hong Kong International Art Fair and meant to complement Art Basel in Hong Kong. Chinese artist, Xu Longshen's painting, "Beholding the Mountain with Awe No.1," was presented by Hanart TZ Gallery. Collectors have been flooding into the city for the past week, including American actress Susan Sarandon, Swiss businessman Ulli Sigg, Britain's Tate galleries director Nicholas Serota, and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. "People are taking Hong Kong very seriously now. Some people say we've finally arrived," says Ooi. As Hong Kong matures as an art market hub and the hype over art fairs swell, more questions will be raised as to the future for local artists and the healthy growth of regional art producers. Sales made at global art fairs accounted for 40% of all dealer sales in 2014, or an estimated $10 billion, the second largest sales channel after in-gallery transactions, according to the European Fine Art Foundation. Briton Peter Liversidge's artwork, "Always," featured 447 light bulbs. "In a week like this past week, the art world has its eye on Hong Kong and it's great, but the real game change will be M+," says Hong Kong-based art consultant Alex Errera referring to the museum of modern and contemporary art and visual culture that is currently being constructed at the West Kowloon Cultural District. "It's easy to fall into the trap of having so many things happening in one week ‚Äî everybody already knows that Hong Kong is a great place for business, it's more important that the attraction to the region can be sustained."

            <cabecalho>Why Singapore is putting its oil back into the ground - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The Jurong rock caverns in Singapore are taking the nations oil reserves deep underground -- the first of its kind in South-East Asia.</descricao>
            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)They're found 150 meters below the ground, taller than a nine-storey building and, once complete, will store 9 million barrels of oil. The Jurong rock caverns in Singapore are defying the challenge of limited land space by creating a deep underground storage facility for the city-state's oil reserves. This is the first project of its kind in South-East Asia, but it has been tried before to great success elsewhere in the world. "In Norway they use it for water treatment plans, in South Korea and Japan they use it for oil storage," says David Tan, Assistant Chief Executive Officer of the Technical &amp; Professional Services Group at JTC Corporation who are handling the industrial development in Singapore. After eight years in development, the first cavern opened in 2014, with four more in the pipeline. Once complete, the Jurong caverns will consist of an underground network of tunnels storing almost 1.5 million cubic meters of liquid hydrocarbons, such as crude oil.  The $700 million dollar venture -- just for phase one -- aims to help Singapore's petrochemical industry prosper by clearing 60 hectares of land above ground for further industrial use. "The 60 hectares of land can be used for about 6 petrochemical plants," says Tan. The petrochemical sector plays a key role in Singapore's $300 billion economy. But as the country has no natural resources to speak of, this income is not generated through oil itself, but through its processing and refinement. According to Singapore's Economic Development Board, the country hosts one of the world's top three export refining centers. The expansion provided by the Jurong rock caverns will make Singapore one of the largest chemical and energy hubs in Asia, helping to reach the nation's goal to double it's petrochemical production by 2030.  The ambitious caverns in Jurong bring with them a range of challenges that engineers need to control, the biggest one being the ingress of water. Water inside the walls of the cavern is inevitable -- and necessary --and prevents the stored oil from leeching out into the rock. But it's a fine balance between too much and not enough. "If too much water comes in, we have to grout the rock," says Tan whose organization strictly monitors the water coming in at all times.  "Singapore is small, so any land is important," says Jian Zhao, Professor of Geomechanics at Monash University, Australia. Zhao was previously at Nanyang Technical University in Singapore, where he worked on the planning behind the caverns. "Free land is a driving force," he says. But this is not the first time the country has gone underground. Aside from shopping malls and metro stations, the city-state's first deep underground facility was an underground ammunition facility by Singapore's Defence Science and Technology Agency -- opened in 2001. "We have good rock geologists in Singapore who can build caverns," says Zhao. "The idea is to make the city more liveable by putting everything undesirable underground." Zhao envisions a future where power stations, electrical stations, waste facilities, water treatment plants, warehouses, and data centres could be moved underground.  The Jurong rock caverns have already secured their first customer to ensure the underground space is used as intended. With four more on the way, the mindset behind Singapore's infrastructure is changing. "Underground, everything is much more stable," says Zhao, referring to factors such as temperature, humidity and vibration. Zhao believes more facilities can comfortably go underground. "We need to convince the public [that] underground space is nice and comfortable," he says. Changes in perception may be needed as JTC are now looking into heading downwards for spaces housing people -- rather than oil -- in the form of an underground science city. The facility could become a working environment for more than 4000 researchers. "[It's a] better environment for laboratories," says Zhao. Zhao further envisions going even deeper, to enable underground spaces with multiple levels. "We've looked at multi-layers already," he says. But he notes the need for extensive planning -- a strength of Singapore. "Planning is important...because underground spaces you can't remove afterwards," says Zhao. But as these visions are developed, their potential to become a reality will depend on the success of facilities such as the Jurong Caverns -- considered by Tan as a prototype for underground developments in Singapore. "A project like this will give us more confidence to carry out the next project underground," says Tan.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)A woman and a child were killed Monday when Taliban militants staged an attack around the Afghan parliament as lawmakers were about to review a government nominee for defense minister. A large car bomb exploded near the outer wall of the compound, sending up a thick plume of smoke. Six Taliban fighters then tried to storm inside, said police spokesman Ebadullah Karimi. Twenty-eight people were wounded in the attack. Afghan security forces managed to fend off the attackers, who then moved into a nearby building, firing rockets and AK-47 machine guns. All six attackers were killed in the ensuing firefight, Karimi said. Inside the parliament building, lawmakers were gathered in a meeting hall when the first explosion struck, Arif Rahmani, a member of parliament, told CNN. The blast shattered glass and shook loose a thin layer of the ceiling that filled the hall with a cloud of dust, he said. The members of parliament had assembled for a general meeting at which Mohammad Masoom Stanikzai, the government's nominee for defense minister, was to be introduced in order to present his plans and policies ahead of a confidence vote. All the lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament building unharmed, Karimi said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said on his Twitter account that the militant group chose to target the parliament on the day the defense minister was to be introduced to lawmakers. The U.N. mission in Afghanistan condemned the attack, calling it "a clear and deliberate affront to democracy in Afghanistan." The U.S. Embassy issued a statement saying the assault showed "blatant disrespect for democracy and the rule of law." Monday's assault is the latest in a string of high-profile attacks by insurgents in the Afghan capital. Recent targets have included hotels housing foreigners, like the Park Palace Guest House, where more than a dozen people were killed last month. More broadly, Afghan forces are grappling with a Taliban offensive across different parts of the country. American-led international troops pulled out of Afghanistan last year. Stanikzai, the defense minister nominee, is the former chief executive of the Joint Secretariat of the Afghanistan High Peace Council, an organization tasked with pursuing peace talks with the Taliban and other insurgent groups in the country. The introductions of nominees for Cabinet minister positions, particularly the defense minister, were held up for months by squabbling between the two leading Afghan presidential candidates, Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah.

</descricao>
            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)Singapore is small, hot and heavily populated -- the 5.5 million residents of the tropical city-state live in less than 750 square kilometres of land. And population is expected to reach 6.9 million by 2030. Despite these challenges, Singapore continues to be amongst the most liveable and economically successful cities in the word, with a GDP equaling that of leading European countries. With more than 50% of the world's population living in cities already (a figure projected to reach 70% by 2050), Singapore -- where everyone is a city dweller -- is setting trends for rapidly urbanizing countries worldwide. But how have they done it?  Concept plans have been in place since 1971, with long-term visions and predictions for the design of Singapore's infrastructure. Such long-term planning was crucial as the population was growing much faster than originally anticipated. "The top priorities for Singapore as a newly independent state were to provide housing for its people and to create jobs," says Khoo Teng Chye, Executive Director of the Centre for Liveable Cities, Singapore. With limited land and no natural resources, there was always a focus on greenery, the environment and intensive development of utilities and infrastructure including power plants, deep-underground sewerage and refuse incineration. "Planning for clean air, clean water and green cover was integral to Singapore's city planning," says Khoo. Decentralization of commercial hubs was also key in the country's urban design to reduce congestion and commuting time -- improving liveability. "High density does not necessarily mean low liveability," says Khoo.  With high-density living comes high-density waste. But Singapore has been organized with its refuse management systems, not only by collecting it efficiently but even employing it to make more land. "They don't have the space to store waste," says Dirk Hebel, from the Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre for Global Environmental Sustainability. Waste is managed instead through regular incineration and the resulting ashes are combined with marine sand to extend Singapore's land mass. "They use ashes for landfill to extend the territory," says Hebel. In addition, the country has set a precedent for water resources through its desalination plants and NEWater plants, where sewage is filtered to recycle it into drinking water. But Hebel's group are now working on new avenues for using waste -- this time to construct buildings instead of land. "In Singapore you have almost 80% high-value resource waste," says Hebel. This category of waste includes plastics and glass, which could be re-purposed for building materials. Hebel's team recently exhibited the possibilities of waste recycling during the 2015 New York City Ideas Festival. They built an arched canopy pavilion comprised of waterproof panels made from discarded beverage containers. The canopy was anchored to a base composed of stacked, wooden pallets. Hebel sees future possibilities in Singapore: "There are things surrounding us that can be used in a secondary life as a building structure," he says.  Due to its close proximity to the equator, Singapore's climate is hot and humid, with temperatures averaging above 30 degrees Celsius and little variation throughout the year. The built-up nature of the city increases temperatures further through the 'heat island' effect -- caused by buildings blocking air flow, transport emissions and long-wave radiation heating up the island nation. As a result, a lot of the city's energy expenditure goes towards cooling people down. "Up to 60% of Singapore's electricity is for buildings," says Arno Schl√ºter, Professor of Architecture and building systems, also with the Future Cities Laboratory. Most buildings use electricity to cool-down and dehumidify public and work spaces. "Singapore is a noisy city due to all the [cooling] units on the wall," says Schl√ºter. To overcome this overconsumption of energy, Schl√ºter's team are now piloting a project with the United World College of South East Asia in which they are dehumidifying the air external to a building and flowing the resulting cool air over the fa√ßade of a building. According to FCL, "the technology consists of passive chilled beams, distributed ventilation units combined with an underfloor air distribution network and new control systems," and removed the need for air conditioning systems. "It means we can save a lot of space -- up to 1/3 of a building," says Schl√ºter. Designs for new buildings in Singapore now also regularly incorporate design for natural ventilation by capturing and promoting wind flow through a public space.  When population increases and demand for land spikes accordingly, the tendency is to build upwards -- as is the case for most cities worldwide. But with unique -- and more pressing -- land restrictions compared to the rest of the world, Singapore has now begun to build downwards and is taking workplaces underground. And they're going deep underground -- first with ammunition facilities, then the Jurong rock caverns storing oil in caverns deep below the ground and soon other industries, such as science laboratories. "[It's a] new way of using underground space on a larger scale," says Jian Zhao, Professor of Geomechanics at Monash University, Australia. Zhao was previously at Nanyang technical university in Singapore where he developed the first research proposals exploring the options to go underground. The design involves digging caverns into rocks more than 100 meters below the ground. "Underground, everything is much more stable," says Zhao referring to factors such as vibrations, temperature and humidity which are important for facilities such as power plants, water reservoirs and industrial settings in general. "The idea is to make the city more liveable by putting everything undesirable underground," he says.  The technological development of Singapore cannot be forgotten as this aspect of city living has long been incorporated into the design of the city-state. The Singapore mass rapid transit (MRT) is considered among the best public transport systems in the world -- needed due to restrictions on vehicle ownership -- and intelligent buildings have been in use for more than a decade aiding movement and entertainment through public and work spaces. But increasing density is putting more pressure on the country's infrastructure. "Singapore needs to adapt and innovate," says Khoo, in order to meet needs for residence, recreation and lifestyle. Innovation has been at the root of the country's development -- both for liveability and sustainability. "Technology is a key feature of green buildings," says Yvonne Soh, General Manager of the Singapore Green Buildings Council. "[It can] respond to the environment quickly and to people," she says. Responding to movements and uses of space in real-time can cut energy requirements dramatically. This emphasis on technology has helped Singapore become one of the Greenest cities in the world.  Singapore is now exporting its expertise in urban planning to other cities in Asia where rapid urbanization is taking place -- including the Tianjin Eco city, China and the new capital city in Andhra Pradesh, India -- and paving the way for cities worldwide to ensure they build sustainably and improve their liveability. "Through greater collaboration among cities, mass urbanization -- the result of a rapidly growing global urban population -- will ultimately benefit the human race," says Khoo.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Australia: A society that brought in tight gun controls - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Tight gun control measures introduced in Australia after a 1996 massacre could be a lesson for the United States as it reels from the Charleston shooting.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It doesn't have to be this way, President Barack Obama said. "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this kind of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency. It is in our power to do something about it." The U.S. has been shaken by multiple high-profile mass shootings in the past few years -- an elementary school in Connecticut, a movie theater in Colorado, two separate incidents at Fort Hood, Texas, and now the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. But can something be done? Australia, a country that in some ways shares the United States' frontier mentality and history as part of the British empire, implemented sweeping gun-control measures that have been successful for nearly two decades. So, theoretically it's possible, but "the power to do something about it" in the U.S. is limited by factors that are deeply rooted in its culture and baked into its founding document. Any change to the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ("...the right to bear arms shall not be infringed") ultimately would require the approval of three-fourths (38) of the states -- forgetting the political hurdle of Congress' even proposing such a measure. The National Rifle Association, with more than 5 million members and a powerful lobbying arm in Washington, reflects a vast interest group in a nation where there are nearly as many firearms (more than 300 million) as there are people. Gun control: Change is possible -- and fast What happened in Australia? Gun violence was bad. A decade of gun massacres had seen more than 100 people shot dead. The last straw was an incident at a popular tourist spot at Port Arthur, Tasmania, in April 1996, when a lone gunman killed 20 people with his first 29 bullets, all in the space of 90 seconds. This "pathetic social misfit," to quote the judge in the case, achieved his final toll of 35 people dead and 18 seriously wounded by firing a military-style semiautomatic rifle. What happened next? Only 12 days after the shootings, in John Howard's first major act of leadership and by far the most popular in his first year as Prime Minister, his government announced nationwide gun law reform. Uniform legislation agreed to by all states and territories -- the national government has no control over gun ownership or use -- specifically addressed mass shootings: Rapid-fire rifles and shotguns were banned, gun owner licensing was tightened and remaining firearms were registered to uniform national standards. How did Australia do it? In two nationwide, federally funded gun buybacks, plus large-scale voluntary surrenders and state gun amnesties both before and after Port Arthur, Australia collected and destroyed more than a million firearms, perhaps a third of the national stock, according to Professor Philip Alpers of the University of Sydney, who is editor of gunpolicy.org. No other nation had attempted anything on this scale. The national government also banned the importation of new automatic and semiautomatic weapons. And the buyback was paid for by a special one-off tax on all Australians. What was the political fallout? It wasn't without cost to John Howard. Political interest groups among his conservative base raised hell, and the move met strong resistance from some in rural areas. His party's coalition partner in those areas suffered in subsequent elections. But the majority of Australians, shocked by the mass killing, backed action. And it worked. Multiple homicides involving gun are exceptionally rare, none have been remotely as bloody and random as the Port Arthur massacre, and none have involved the sort of weapons whose importation was banned. What exactly happened to murder and mass killing? In the years after the Port Arthur massacre, the risk of dying by gunshot in Australia fell by more than 50% -- and stayed there. A 2012 study by Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University also found the buyback led to a drop in firearm suicide rates of almost 80% in the following decade. In the 19 years since the announcement of legislation specifically designed to reduce gun massacres, Australia has seen no mass shootings. As Howard wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times in 2013, "Today, there is a wide consensus that our 1996 reforms not only reduced the gun-related homicide rate, but also the suicide rate." Can America follow it? The gun culture in the United States is a powerful factor that can't be ignored. Howard acknowledged those key differences in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour in 2013. "I don't come here with any lectures," he said. Australia started with a much lower gun death rate, he said, and "we don't have constitutional guarantees in relation to these things." "However," he added, "that doesn't alter the fact that our murder rate using guns has fallen and there's not much doubt in my mind that it's the availability of guns that causes such a high rate of murder using weapons." How other countries deal with massacre nightmare  </corpo>

            <descricao>Squirming seafood, aromatic Indian spices, fresh flowers -- Singapore's wet markets are a melting pot of cultures, colors and a reminder of days gone by</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN Travel's series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy. Singapore (CNN)Singapore's lively wet markets provide a throw-back experience many visitors might not expect to find in a glitzy world capital. Here, air-conditioned, squeaky-clean shopping malls are replaced with the shouts of stall vendors and a dose of good old-fashioned commerce. And local residents. Singaporeans and expats alike find buying groceries from one of the city's many wet markets is an effective way to save pennies. (A "wet market" is simply one that sells mostly meat, animals and produce as opposed to durable consumer goods.) The best time to explore is bright and early, when the produce is freshest and stall owners are at their most energetic. We visited three of the city's best-known markets and met the people who keep them running.  In the heart of Little India, Singapore's largest indoor wet market is also the most difficult to navigate. The nearly 300 stalls are known for their aromatic India spices, huge selection of fresh fruit and veggies and still squirming fish. This market is also open later than most, generally not closing until late afternoon. Tekka Centre, 665 Buffalo Road, Singapore; open daily from 6:30 a.m.  This is one of the city's trendiest neighborhoods and its wet market is frequented by many expats as well as locals. Among the usual colorful array of seasonal fruits and vegetables, there's imported New Zealand and Australian beef. It's also a great place to buy flowers, especially orchids. Tiong Bahru Wet Market, 30 Seng Poh Road, Singapore; open daily 6 a.m.-noon  This big and bustling market in the basement of the Chinatown Complex specializes in live seafood and exotic animals. Big fat frogs, gourmet turtles, stingrays and eels are on sale -- alive and kicking. Shoppers can take them home just like that, or the stall owner will prepare them for you. This is also one of the best places in town to buy Chinese medicine and other dried goods that vendors claim can treat practically any health problem. Chinatown Wet Market, Chinatown Complex, 335 Smith St.; open daily 8 a.m.-noon Rory Daniel is a freelance photographer based in Singapore. </corpo>

            <descricao>The Sanskrit word "yoga" may mean union but, for many in India, yoga has never been more divisive.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)The Sanskrit word "yoga" may mean union but, for some in India, yoga has never been more divisive. June 21 marks the first ever International Day of Yoga, an event that's driven by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A faithful yoga practitioner for years, Modi persuaded the United Nations last year to devote a day to the ancient discipline. This Sunday, around 45,000 people in New Delhi attempted to break the world record for the single largest session of yoga. Modi was present at the public demonstration which included civil servants and students, many of whom were ordered to practice their chaturangas and downward dogs ahead of the event. Similar yoga events are being held all around the globe. Modi's worldwide yoga vision, however, isn't sitting well with everyone. Some in India's Muslim community, which makes up around 15% of the population, say they are feeling marginalized.  Although it's viewed mainly as a form of physical exercise in the west, yoga carries religious associations in India. Muslim associations like the influential Islamic scholars group, Jamiat Ulema I Hind, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and several prominent imams have taken issue with a common sequence called "sun salutations" which they interpret as sun worship. "Om" which is often chanted in yoga classes is also a sacred sound in Dharmic religions. "We do not know how it has been approved by the UN," Abdul Rahim Qureshi, an All India Muslim Personal Law Board spokesperson told CNN. "A true Muslim cannot take part in yoga. The yoga is made compulsory for the primary and high school students. What are they teaching little children? The government should not take up this cause of yoga and impose them on non-Hindus." To ease the backlash, Indian authorities reassured the public that sun salutations would be dropped from the event, though chanting "om" would still be a part of it. Government officials also pointed out that out of 177 sponsoring nations, 47 are from the Organization of Islamic Countries.  Objections from India's Muslim community are not the only point of strain. Although yoga's roots are undeniably Indian, much of what is practiced today is an Americanized version. There are over 25 million people who practice yoga in the United States alone, by far the largest single market, and that's grown 33% since 2009, according to a study from the Sports and Fitness Industry Association. It's a multi-billion dollar market that extends to $420 yoga leggings and $140 mats. The vigorous push from the Indian government has given new life to a debate over who owns yoga and what defines it. Newly-appointed Indian minister for yoga Shripad Yesso Naik said it's something India wants to reclaim from the west. "We're trying to establish to the world that it's ours," Naid told the Washington Post. Noah Maze, a LA-based yoga teacher however believes the yoga practiced today is something new. "While it has roots in practices from India, and certainly we can find lists of asanas in some of the medieval alchemical texts of hatha yoga, what is practiced today really is an innovation and evolution of what was practiced traditionally," Maze said. "I would expect that Indian yogis may be looking at yoga's explosion internationally, and feeling a sense of ownership and entitlement to the practices and concepts," Maze added.  Striking the right balance between respecting the tradition's roots and its new incarnations as yoga's popularity surges is a question many practitioners grapple with. "I quiver a bit when hearing of the lax usage of the word 'yoga' these days," said Tim Feldmann, an Ashtanga teacher who co-founded the Miami Life Center with his yogi wife Kino Macgregor. "A yoga studio down the road from us here in Miami offers 'yoga booty ballet'. In my ear, that is obviously an only commercial aspirational use of the word." For Macgregor, it's a mindset much more than the ability to twist like a pretzel and she emphasizes it's open to anyone. "This brilliance does not belong to any one culture," she said.  </corpo>

            <descricao>A dog meat festival in southern China sparks clashes between animal lovers and dog meat eaters. </descricao>
            <corpo>Yulin, Guangxi province, China (CNN)Boss Ning has been running a dog meat restaurant in this southern Chinese city since 1981 and she says business is thriving. Her customers can feast on crispy dog or dog hot pot, as well as lamb, duck and other meats. Dog is particularly popular in the region during the sweltering heat of summer and each June locals and visitors gather for a dog meat eating festival, which this year takes place Monday. "Crispy dogs smell good and taste delicious," she says, declining to give her full name. Her customers seem happy too: "Dog meat is a delicacy. It's nourishing," says one man who gave his name as Huang. But the festival, which sees some 10,000 dogs served up as meals, has become a battlefront in China's nascent animal rights movement. Activists say many of the animals are stolen household pets that are then transported thousands of miles crammed into wire cages and denied food and water. Many arrive at their destination malnourished and diseased, before being slaughtered and served up to customers, they say. Friend or food? Why dog meat trade divides China  A new generation of Chinese animal lovers increasingly view dogs as companions. Of China's estimated 130 million dogs, at least 27 million are urban pets, according to research group Euromonitor. And there are signs that dog meat is losing its popularity in some places. Ten years ago, it was common to see dogs being killed for meat in Beijing's suburbs, says Peter Li, at the Humane Society International. Today, that is something that is rarely seen, he says. And in Guangzhou, a city well-known for its exotic eating habits, a dog meat restaurant that had been in operation for 51 years recently closed. This year, dozens of activists and their pet dogs have descended on Yulin. Some plan to hand in a petition to the local authorities demanding an end to the killing of dogs for food. Others attempted to rescue the animals from the slaughter house. Hao Wei, an animal rights activist who'd traveled hundreds of miles from Xian in northwestern China, said he'd saved five dogs and two cats. "We bought them at the place where the dogs are being killed," he said, adding that he'd spent up to $32 on each animal. "I hope the government would pay more attention to food safety." "The dogs have skin disease and all kinds of other diseases but the butcher says it should be fine once they've been scorched." The festival is also generating outrage internationally, with celebrities like Ricky Gervais calling for it to be stopped.  The clashes between activists and dog meat traders has led to a tense atmosphere at the city's markets where the dogs are traded. A CNN crew was stopped from filming by security officials and stallholders brandishing mops -- one elderly lady wielded a knife. The opposition to the dog meat trade is not just from outsiders. Xie Yanli works in a local cafeteria and says she supports the animal rights activists. "Most of the people who eat it are middle aged men. They eat dogs and drink beer," she said. "I don't eat dogs, I never did and won't do in the future." Liu, a college student from the provincial capital Nanning, said it was his first time to visit the festival. He fears it might be shut down year. "We just wanted to take a look and try things out." Restaurant owners say the publicity the animal rights activists have brought to the city has, perversely, only been good for business. "Originally, people from other provinces across the country didn't know about our dog meat delicacy but after our restaurant was shown on TV, they all come and try it out," says Ning, the restaurant owner. And many in Yulin don't see what the fuss is about. "Eating dog meat is a regular thing for me. Dog rearing is the same as rearing pigs or chickens, there is no difference," said a man who gave his name as Zhong, who was enjoying dog hot pot with a friend.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The ramshackle house is full of the symbols of time passing. Clocks -- there are at least five of them, none of them telling the right time -- dot the walls. And calendars too, out of date and unmarked; no birthdays, events or memories written into them, just left blank. This is the home of Manee Chanviset, 77, and Samarn Charoensuk, 78, a Thai couple, whose children left them behind long ago. One, their youngest, Maleenu Charoensuk -- nicknamed "Lek" -- had been missing, feared dead, for years. Now they sit in their home, alone. When their children left, times got hard. The parents were reduced to picking through garbage, scavenging to find things that they could sell, so they could eat.  Theirs would have been an untold misery, but for the Labour Rights Promotion Network (LPN), an NGO which found Lek, improbably, stranded on an Indonesian island. They took down information about his family and his hometown, and tracked down his parents. They spoke for the first time in almost eight years, a call arranged by LPN, ears pressed against a borrowed mobile phone. When we arrived at their home it's time to join them as they pick up their son from the airport. They don't have the money to go themselves so another NGO, Stella Maris Seafarer, is taking them. As we walk in, the organization has also brought the couple some provisions, the result of donations. It's an extraordinary turn of events for the elderly couple.  She doesn't have much, but Lek's mother, Manee, buttons up her best, blue silk shirt. It hangs from her thin figure, but she looks so happy -- and nervous. She called Lek's estranged sister for moral support as soon as they heard the government was bringing him back to Thailand, and she is part of the welcoming committee -- an ever-increasing number of family and relatives who have returned to witness his homecoming. But his father won't go to the airport. He says he is not well and too weak, but it seems he is overwhelmed. He breaks down as we set off for the airport, his head in his hands. Tears of joy -- and perhaps disbelief -- that their son is finally coming home. Manee has never even been to the airport before, but this trip is one she's longed for for years. The entire journey she speaks quietly, in a daze. "I never thought this day would come," she says. "My heart is pounding. All I want is to see his face. All I want is to see his face" READ MORE: Seafood from slavery: Can Thailand tackle the crisis in its fishing industry?  When they spot him they cry, and she clings to him, her tiny frame trying to hold him in this moment for as long as she can. "Let's go home... let's go home," she whispers. "Don't you go anywhere again." She takes a good look at him. He is much thinner, and he looks so much older. Lek is in shock at first. He can barely speak but tells his mother, the woman he hasn't seen for eight years, that he didn't think he would ever make it back home. He had disappeared without a trace, without warning. His parents assumed he'd taken a fishing job, like he'd done once before. It's not difficult at all to see why poor young men risk their lives at sea, to try and earn some money to alleviate their extreme poverty. His family's home is a rusty shack of carefully choreographed corrugated iron -- his parents must have built it years ago, before their strength left them.  He tells us how he was tricked onto a boat, at the very beginning of his eight-year ordeal. "I was drunk and they took me to the boat," he recalls. "I told them I wanted to leave but they didn't let me. They hit me and forced me to board. There were so many men." They told him he could go for a three-month trial and that he was free to leave if he didn't like it. He didn't know then that he wouldn't see his home for almost a decade. He says he was on the boat for about seven months before it landed at a port in Indonesia. "Some of us got off to buy some drinks for fellow workers. The captain was so angry he beat us and stabbed me. He abandoned me on an Indonesian island. " "There, I was stuck on land carrying rocks in exchange for food," he says, eyes downcast. READ MORE: Thai PM vows to clamp down on slavery in fishing  He was discovered by LPN only when Indonesian authorities began a clampdown on illegal fishing boats in their waters. Thousands of men from countries across Southeast Asia poured off the boats, telling tales of being trapped at sea. Others were already on islands like Lek's, abandoned with no paperwork. Now he's home, he won't go back, he says. And his parents won't let him. They cling to him. But Lek -- and hundreds of others like him -- is returning home to the same poverty and lack of prospects as they suffered before. They may have just returned but have a long journey ahead; the struggle to settle back in and to find work to feed their families -- in the same conditions that led them, years ago, to being trafficked and forced to work as slaves.

            <cabecalho>Korea's new food addiction: Beer and chicken - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>South Korea's fried-chicken-and-beer combo is a cracking food sensation and the country's latest global export.</descricao>
            <corpo>Seoul (CNN)Neither fried chicken nor beer originated in Korea. But the union of these two overseas imports has become a culturally significant force in South Korean drinking culture. The country is bursting with places to eat chicken. As of 2013, South Korea had more than 20,000 fried chicken eateries. The market for fried chicken is worth about 3 trillion KRW (about $3 billion), according to Statistics Korea. There's even a festival devoted to chicken and beer in Daegu.  Like any celebrity power couple, chicken and beer have a co-joined nickname: chimaek ("chi" for chicken and "maek" for maekju, Korean for beer). Chimaek has been around for a while but the term itself became widespread in 2010, the year of the World Cup, and something of a golden year for chimaek. Its popularity hasn't abated, and its significance has risen from national dish to national pastime. "Chimaek is like a sigh of relief," says Kim Min-jeong, who works for a legal firm in Seoul. "Chimaek after work lets me know I've survived another day." "It's part of our national culture," says bar owner Park Vito, who sometimes gets chicken delivered to his bar. "Chimaek is both an industry and a part of our dining culture." Korean-style, chimaek-worthy chicken is defined by an enormous range of choices that fall under the chimaek umbrella. Some claim only a specific frying method qualifies as "authentic" Korean-style chicken, but there are so many chimaek styles -- chicken places are forever hatching new techniques and flavor combinations -- that no one really has a say on what counts and what doesn't. There's proto-Korean fried chicken, the whole roast chicken (tongdak). There's chicken cooked on a charcoal fire (sutbul chicken). There's boneless (sunsal), slathered in sweet and spicy sauce (yangnyeom) and smothered in leeks (padak). There's no hierarchy, only a diverse range that caters to a variety of tastes. Chicken was once considered a delicacy in Korea, stewed whole with dates and ginseng and reserved for special occasions. Fried chicken for the masses came with the launch of the first South Korean vegetable oil product in 1971, alongside a rapidly growing chicken industry. Fried chicken was embraced as an excellent food pairing for draft beer, and subsequent years saw the debut of multiple chicken franchises. Their growth was bolstered by the financial crisis of the late 1990s -- some who lost their jobs turned to opening chicken joints.  Korean-style fried chicken is becoming popular abroad. The chimaek fever that swept through China in the past year can be traced to a line from the popular South Korean TV drama, "My Love from the Star." Chimaek makes frequent appearances as the favored comfort food of the drama's heroine, who says, "It's snowing. How can you not have chimaek?" The show has inspired a chimaek festival in the Chinese city of Ningbo, social media memes and long lines outside of Korean fried chicken restaurants in China. Xinhua, China's state news agency, hailed the TV drama and the chimaek trend as a driving force in reviving chicken farms in 2014, which have suffered due to H7N9 avian flu concerns. "Sales at the Kychon Chicken Ziteng Road location in Shanghai more than tripled over the previous year, following the success of ('My Love from the Star')," according to Gil Yeong-hwa of Kyochon Chicken. "We had customers standing in line for two hours for their chicken." Kyochon created a stir in the domestic delivery chicken scene in 1991 with its trademark soy sauce chicken. Today the major chain remains a favorite at home and has opened locations in the United States, China and Southeast Asia. "The effect of the drama wasn't as big in the U.S. as it was in China, but sales have been rising continuously," says Gil. "And Korean-style fried chicken is becoming more popular in the U.S. Kyochon's garlicky, soy sauce chicken, which is different from the fried chicken they might have at KFC, for example, is getting an especially good response abroad." Bonchon is another Korean chicken franchise that Korean chimaek lovers might not recognize -- its overseas locations (more than 150) far outnumber its two Korean locations. But according to Lee Jin-woo, manager of the Haeundae location in the South Korean city of Busan, Bonchon's distinctive sauce is still made in Korea and shipped to outlets around the world.  Chimaek isn't the only word that has come from the marriage of "chicken" and "beer." Chimaek fanatics call themselves "chideokhu," a combination of the words "chicken" and "deokhu," which means "maniac." These chideokhu might call chicken "chineunim," "chicken" and the Korean word for "God." Connoisseurs who can differentiate between brands without consulting the delivery box are chimmeliers, a mishmash of "chimaek" and "sommelier." There's even a chicken-specific hallelujah: chillelujah!  Whatever the level of chimaek awareness overseas, it's never a problem finding a chimaek spot in Seoul. In fact, the sheer variety can be overwhelming. Here are some places to start. 1. Saerona Hof This snug chimaek spot opened in 1977 and has become the sort of place that has a wait even on weekdays. The curry powder-topped chicken (18,000 KRW/$16) is by far the most popular and deserving item on the menu. The flavor is enough to arouse suspicion about what other magic powders might be at work. The effects of "My Love from the Star" were felt here also. "But we were popular before that, too," says owner Gang Hyeong-seok, who still fries and serves the chicken herself. Saerona Hof, 522, Dosan-daero, Gangnam-gu, Seoul; +82 2 544 2802; open daily from 5 p.m.-3:30 a.m. 2. Sai Chicken Long considered one of Seoul's top chimaek spots, Sai, which means "between," used to be tucked into a narrow alleyway in the relatively inaccessible and hilly neighborhood of Buam-dong. There's a second location in the slightly more accessible Hongdae area. Both spots serve Sai's famous set of fried chicken and sukju (green bean spout) -- with beer, of course. Sai Chicken original Buam-dong location, 1, Baekseokdong-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul; +82 2 395 4242; opening times differ from day to day Sai Chicken Hongdae location, 61-6, Dongmak-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul; +82 2 6403 4242; opening times differ from day to day 3. Han River Delivery "Chimaek with friends on the Han River in the summer makes even the heat bearable," says Kim Ji-ha, a Seoul-based designer and chimaek lover. "I like bicycling to the Han River, and spreading out a blanket on the grass, and getting chicken delivered in only the way you can get it delivered here in Korea -- directly to the park," says Kim. Han River chimaek means BYOB or delivery, but you have your pick of picnic spots along the riverside, and your pick of chicken franchises. Banpo Park is a popular spot that chicken delivery scooters know well. The picnic delivery market is so fierce that you'll see peddlers from nationwide franchises and neighborhood mom-and-pops handing out fliers around the park. Han River Banpo Park, 40, Sinbanpo-ro 11-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul; +82 2 591 5943 Kyochon Chicken, +82 1577 1991 (local calls only); open noon-11:30 p.m. Chicken Pelicana; +82 1588 9292 (local calls only); opening hours differ by location 4. Sangsu Ddobagi Chicken The Sangsu-dong location of the Ddobagi franchise feels like a mom-and-pop shop. As with many neighborhood spots Ddobagi, the chicken comes with a cheap price tag. The Ddobagi Chicken starts at 10,000 KRW ($9). Ddobagi Chicken Sangsu/Hongdae location; 27, Wausan-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul; +82 2 3142 0991 5. The Frypan "The boneless fried chicken at the Frypan is (addictive)," says local journalist Kurt Achin, who has lived and eaten chicken in South Korea for the past decade. The Frypan rose to prominence by serving chicken and beer in a bright, cafe-like environment, stepping away from the norm of cramped pubs. The chicken tenders without bones is available at Frypan locations all over the country. The two below are located near major universities. The Frypan Sinchon, 23, Yonsei-ro 12-gil, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul; +82 2 393 7707; open daily 5 p.m.-2 a.m. The Frypan Seoul National University Station,168, Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul; +82 2 876 2202; open daily 5 p.m.-2 a.m.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Toxic moonshine has killed 102 people and seriously sickened scores of others of drinkers from a Mumbai slum, Indian police say.</descricao>
            <corpo>Mumbai (CNN)Toxic moonshine has killed 102 people and seriously sickened scores of others of drinkers from a Mumbai slum, Indian police say. Forty-six others have been hospitalized, with many in a critical condition, after consuming the illegal homebrew, Mumbai police spokesman Dhananjay Kulkarni told CNN. Authorities said four men and two women had been booked over the deaths, on charges including culpable homicide, poisoning and abetting a crime. Eight local police have also been suspended for negligence, he said, while the suspect liquor has been sent for testing. The incident took place near Laxmi Nagar, a large slum in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Deaths from cheap, illegally brewed liquor -- often containing toxic methanol -- are not uncommon in India. The moonshine is typically brewed in villages before being smuggled into cities, where it sells for about 10 cents a glass -- about a third the price of legally brewed liquor. More than 160 people died from drinking a bad batch of moonshine in West Bengal in 2011, while in January, at least 25 people died and 125 were hospitalized after drinking illegal homebrew in Uttar Pradesh.  There were emotional scenes in Laxmi Nagar slum Monday as the body of another victim was returned to his family. Loud wails came from a crowd of about 200 people which had gathered to see the body of Satyavel Nagan Kawander brought home. Kawander, a 35-year-old day laborer, left behind a wife and three children under the age of 11, they said. Nearby, a young boy who had lost his father had his head shaved, a traditional Hindu sign of mourning. Many men in the desperately poor slum work as manual laborers, separating garbage or cleaning gutters, earning 50 -- 100 rupees ($0.78-$1.57) a day, locals told CNN. They tended to drink to cope with the stresses of their jobs dealing with garbage or human sewage, said Uma Chandra Harijan, whose husband, a gutter cleaner, is now battling for his life. "They have to drink to get rid of the smell, to numb their senses," she said, adding that her husband drank every night. Harijan, who has a son, 3, and a 15-day-old daughter, also lost her father to the illegal moonshine. Nearby, Jyoti Sangar Sankate was mourning her husband, who had been a drinker for years, she said. "I don't know what happened this time," she said. "He came home and vomited, said he was losing vision. His body started shaking. He died the same day." Locals pointed out two houses in the slum they said the local bootleggers operated from; both were closed Monday.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>The other side of Jordan's refugee crisis - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>When we think of refugees, we usually think of camps. But many refugees have made new -- and successful -- lives for themselves in Jordan.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's Connect the World is in Amman this week, and we want you tell us what you'd like to know about Jordan's refugee crisis -- send us your questions in the comments below, and we'll answer the best ones live Thursday on the show at 6 p.m. Jordan time. Amman, Jordan (CNN)On a Thursday afternoon it's hard to find a table at Al-Mahar (The Oysters), an Iraqi restaurant in Amman, Jordan. But for many of the patrons here, it's not just about the food, it's a taste of home. Eating Iraqi food makes you feel like you are in Iraq," Mahdi al-Zobai says as he dips his tanour bread into masgouf, a traditional Iraqi dish of barbecued carp. Al-Zobai left his home in Abu Ghraib 11 years ago and moved to neighboring Jordan, where he settled down in Amman and married a Jordanian woman. "I am used to life in Jordan now, but that doesn't mean I don't think of my country and long for it," Al-Zobai says. "Every time I hear an Iraqi song, I cry." The restaurant is packed with many other Iraqis who, like Al-Zobai, live here but miss their homeland. Al-Mahar first opened in Baghdad in the 1980s. But when its owner, Abu Haytham, had to flee the violence there in 2004, he moved to Amman and brought his restaurant with him. "I provide people with something to try and make them feel less homesick," he says. The restaurant has been a huge hit over the past decade, popular with Haytham's displaced countrymen but also with locals who until recently had never tasted masgouf. Haytham, 70, sits on his chair outside the restaurant greeting customers. He speaks with pride about the success of his business, but when speaking about Iraq, he is bitter -- and he doesn't think he'll ever see his country again. "We have now reached a stage where we are convinced that our country is finished," he says. "I like living in Jordan. My sons are in the U.S., but I want to stay here because this is our country now." Over the last 12 years Jordan has become home to more than half a million Iraqis, the majority from their country's upper and middle classes. They live in cities like Amman and the government does not consider them to be refugees. Before the U.S.-led invasion and the Iraqi exodus of 2003, Jordan took in Palestinian refugees in 1948 and 1967. They were granted Jordanian citizenship, and today it is estimated that more than half of the country's population is of Palestinian origin. More recently, Jordan's stability in a turbulent region has once again turned the country into a sanctuary for those fleeing violence. Over the past four years Jordan has opened its doors to 1.4 million Syrian refugees displaced by the civil war engulfing the country. About 20% of these Syrian refugees live in the Zaatari and Azraq camps. Zaatari has become so crowded that it is now considered Jordan's fifth largest city. But the vast majority of Syrians are urban refugees in cities and towns across the country -- and the influx has been a burden on an already-strained economy. In some cities, Jordanians blame Syrians for higher living costs, like rent increases, or for taking jobs by working for less money than a Jordanian would. But there are some Syrian refugees who have moved their businesses to Jordan and say they are contributing positively to Jordan's growing economy. Abu Abdullah had a good life in Damascus, but the war forced him to shut down the factory he owned and flee to Jordan with his wife and three children in 2012. As soon as he got to Amman he began exploring business opportunities. The restaurant and caf√© sector looked the most promising. "One needs to live, and work is life," Abdullah says. "You have to work and survive, you cannot surrender." His fast food and fresh juice restaurant, Orange Al-Sham, is one of many restaurants, cafes and sweetshops on Amman's bustling Madina Al-Munawara Street. "It is very difficult restarting your life from scratch, it's like moving to a different planet -- especially when you have children," he says. "It's a neighboring country and it's like our own people, but it's still difficult." Despite the continuing bloodshed at home, with no end in sight to the war, Abdullah still clings on to the hope that someday soon they will be able to return to Syria. He says his business is doing well, and that his children have slowly adjusted to life in Amman, but the sad look in his eyes reflects the human cost behind this new life. "At the beginning everything is tough, you have to condition yourself to the circumstances you're in," Abdullah says. "No one leaves their country because they want to."

            <descricao>On the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. Shereen El Feki says that needs to change.</descricao>
            <corpo>Shereen El Feki is the author of "Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World," a study of changing sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET. Cairo, Egypt (CNN)In a packed Cairo theater a couple of months ago, Ali Qandil brought down the house. "Why do Egyptian fathers cry at their daughters' weddings?" the comedian asked the crowd. "Because they know their little girls will be having sex for the first time." In Egypt's current conservative climate, Qandil's well-aimed thrust at sexual taboos was enough to send the audience into stitches, even as the theater management reached for its smelling salts. The show was courtesy of Al-Hubb Thaqafa ("Love is Culture"), a groundbreaking social media platform offering straight talk on love, sex and relationships in Arabic. Launched just over a year ago, its website, YouTube channel and social feeds have attracted more than nine million visitors, mainly from Egypt and Morocco. Al-Hubb Thaqafa's no-nonsense approach to sex, offering accurate information on everything from the basic facts of life to the finer points of fellatio, is a welcome development in a region where teachers are often too embarrassed to communicate even the barebones sexual and reproductive curriculum on offer, and parents generally draw a veil of silence over such topics with their kids. For Ali Qandil, sex is an endless source of humor -- just as it is anywhere else in the world. But on the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. In recent weeks, accounts of the arrest and abuse of dozens of gay men and transsexual women in Egypt, or mass sexual exploitation under ISIS' reign of terror, or Morocco's recent ban on a new film which lays bare the country's thriving sex trade, do little to dispel the image of societies mired in sexual repression. But by emphasizing sex as a pleasure to be enjoyed, rather than a problem to be solved, Al-Hubb Thaqafa hearkens to a long tradition of free and frank exchange on sexual matters in Arabic. Short of cybersex and internet porn, there isn't much its platforms tackle that our forefathers from weren't writing about more than a millennium ago. READ MORE: 13 signs you're probably in Cairo There is nothing un-Islamic about talking about sex; indeed, many of the great works of Arabic erotica were written by religious scholars. But over the centuries, and in particular in recent decades with rise of Islamic fundamentalism, societies across the Arab region have become far less comfortable in their sexual skin. Al-Hubb Thaqafa offers a chance (in part by reclaiming Arabic as a language of sexuality and offering a "respectable" alternative to street slang) for men and women to talk each other about sex -- asking questions, sharing personal experiences and contesting each other's opinions without the usual embarrassment or censure. Such opportunities are all too rare offline. It's been two years since I published "Sex and the Citadel" -- a five-year investigation into sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region, and their intersection with politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations. Since then, the grand political aspirations which fed the Arab Spring have either frosted over, as in Egypt, or burnt up in the conflagration now consuming Libya, Yemen and Syria. Sex might seem an odd focus these days, given all the other pressing issues in the region. But it is never far from politics, as authoritarian powers -- be they military-backed presidents or religious extremists -- know only too well, using matters of flesh, wrapped in selective interpretations of Islam, to clamp down on their communities. This is sadly true beyond the borders of the Middle East as well. But the converse also holds. Realizing the rallying cries of the recent uprisings -- "freedom", "justice" and "dignity" -- in private life will, in the long run, have profound implications for public life as well. When it comes to sex, it is never black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In this, as with so many other aspects of life, there are at least 50 shades of gray. On my travels, I've met men and women across the Arab region who are exploring that spectrum. Doctors like Chafik Chraibi, a Moroccan obstetrician whose efforts to open up his country's restrictive abortion laws have helped to catalyze a recent small step in legal reform. Educators like Safa Tamish, a Palestinian living in Israel, who is working to get sex education into schools and families across the West Bank. Or activists like the founders of Chouf and Damj, two new Tunisian NGOS, which are among the dozens of groups across the region trying to find a place for men and women whose sexualities or gender identities break the mold. There are many, many more such initiatives -- combating sexual violence, or securing the rights of unwed mothers or providing sexual health services to unmarried youth, for example -- springing up across the Middle East, often on very rocky ground. The most successful work slowly, along the grain of religion and culture. Confrontation -- be it political protests in Tahrir Square or Femen-style baring of breasts -- is not the way to achieve tangible, durable change in the Arab region, as recent events have clearly demonstrated. For too many -- particularly women -- sex is still bound up in shame, which makes it a powerful tool of political and social control. Sexual freedoms are hard to exercise when family interests trump individual choice, or when appearance counts for more than reality -- when virginity is defined by a piece of anatomy -- an intact hymen -- rather than a state of chastity, or when prostitution masquerades as marriage between wealthy visitors and desperate refugees. Shifting the political, economic and social conditions which underpin these realities is the work of a generation at least. But at least in a few places, positive change is slowly taking root. As my Egyptian grandmother used to say, "If there were seeds for patience, I would have planted fields." In other words, what we need is a sexual evolution, not revolution.

            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)A court in Egypt upheld a death sentence Tuesday against former President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, 63, was sentenced to death last month for his role in a 2011 prison break. Morsy, along with 16 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders, was also given a life sentence for espionage. Life in Egypt means 25 years. Three more senior members of the organization -- Khairat Al Shater, Mohamed Beltagy and Ahmed Abdel Alaty -- were sentenced to death by hanging. The political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the decision "politicized" and the charges "fabricated." "President Morsy's trial has fallen far below the most basic international legal standards," a statement from the Muslim Brotherhood said. "Today's announcement is another nail in the coffin for democracy in Egypt." It called on the international community to stop what it called the "cruel dictatorship" of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The military ousted Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, in 2013. Opinion: The folly of Morsy's death sentence CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Sarah Sirgany contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>U.N.: War crimes possible on each side in Gaza conflict - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A U.N report says both sides may have committed war crimes during the violence between Israel and Palestinian armed groups last summer.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Bader Qdeih was 6 years old. Daniel Tregerman was 4. Both are dead now. A highly anticipated U.N. report into the violence between Israel and Palestinian armed groups last year has concluded that both sides might have committed war crimes. The Comission of Inquiry report, which took nine months to complete, called the loss of life "heartbreaking." The statistics themselves are shocking: 1,462 Palestinian civilians killed, more than 11,000 injured. Six Israeli civilians dead; 1,600 hurt. But as horrifying as those statistics are, it is the children who give us once more the capacity to care. In August, Daniel was playing near his home at Kibbutz Nahal Oz. A siren sounded. A mere three seconds later -- not enough time for him to reach the protected room with the rest of his family -- a mortar hit the family car. Shrapnel hit Daniel, killing him. On the other side, Bader was seen pleading for help from people fleeing Khuza'a, 25 miles south of Gaza City. He was holding his intestines, which were coming out of his abdomen. "I don't want to die," he said. "Don't leave me." But his evacuation was delayed, and he did not survive.  "Palestinian and Israeli children were savagely affected by the events," said the report, by an independent commission of inquiry set up by the United Nations. "Children on both sides suffered from bed-wetting, shaking at night, clinging to parents, nightmares and increased levels of aggressiveness." In Gaza, according to UNICEF, more than 1,500 children were orphaned. The conflict was triggered by a series of events. On June 12, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and killed by two members of Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. Israel initiated a crackdown on Hamas. Then Hamas responded with rocket fire toward Israeli towns. And Israel responded in turn on July 8 with a military operation that lasted seven weeks. In its report, the independent commission -- with which Israel declined to cooperate -- says it "was able to gather substantial information pointing to serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law by Israel and by Palestinian armed groups. In some cases, these violations may amount to war crimes."  In particular, the report points toward civilian casualties on each side and a lack of sufficient measures to prevent them. In addition, the report says the Palestinians' extrajudicial executions of alleged "collaborators" -- 16 of whom were dragged from their prison cells and shot by firing squads -- might also constitute war crimes. "The intent of some Palestinian armed groups to direct attacks against civilians is demonstrated by statements indicating that their intended targets were civilians or large population centers in Israel," the report said. On the other side, international humanitarian law requires that "effective advance warning be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population." The report said the Israelis sometimes used what were called "roof-knocks" -- strikes by small missiles before a major strike. But the commission concluded that roof-knocks cannot be considered effective warnings. "The commission was deeply moved by the immense suffering of the Palestinian and Israeli victims, who have been subjected to repeated rounds of violence," the report said.  Investigators found that, in at least six cases, Israel used precision-guided munitions in airstrikes against residential buildings without any military objective. In the ground war, the report says that Israel used high-explosive munitions in densely populated urban environments, such as Shujai'iya, which risk civilian lives. Israel conducted more than 6,000 airstrikes on Gaza and used more than 5,000 tons of munitions in the ground offensive, including 14,500 tank shells and approximately 35,000 artillery shells, according to the report. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the report "biased" and said that any country would defend itself the way Israel did if it were attacked. "Israel strongly defends itself and does everything possible according to international law," Netanyahu told lawmakers Monday. "We are not the only ones who say that, and we published last week a detailed report from professionals which details the actions taken by us in accordance with international law as opposed to terrorists who shoot on civilians and hide behind civilians." Hamas released a statement welcoming the findings on alleged violations by the Israelis. "This clear condemnation of the occupation entails bringing Israel's leaders to the International Criminal Court, and all international courts to judge them for their crimes against our people," the statement said. The report also condemned Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. The report said the tunnels that stretched from Gaza into Israel were designed "to spread terror among the civilian population." "The use of rockets in the possession of Palestinian armed groups, indiscriminate in nature, and any targeted mortar attacks against civilians constitute violations of international humanitarian law, in particular the fundamental principle of distinction, which may amount to a war crime," the report said. Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, and the European Union. The Hamas statement made no mention of the alleged violations on its side of the conflict. CNN's Oren Liebermann also contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)ISIS has claimed responsibility for several bombings that occurred in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Wednesday. A statement posted to social media and then re-tweeted by ISIS supporters asserted that four car bombs in Sanaa targeted pro-Houthi locations, including the home of a Houthi cleric Taha al-Mutawakel. The death toll from the attacks is unclear. Two sources from the office of Brig. Gen. Sharaf Luqman, the spokesman for the Houthi-allied army, said at least 24 people were killed. The Yemeni Ministry of Health said the number of dead was at least five. The targets also included two mosques and a political office, ISIS claimed. Houthi officials said three mosques were among the sites attacked. ISIS also has claimed responsibility for mosque attacks before. In March, more than 130 people were killed by suicide bombing at two mosques frequented by Houthis. While it was not reported if any young people were killed Wednesday, UNICEF announced a day earlier that almost four times as many children have died in the past 10 weeks as a result of the conflict in Yemen as were killed in 2014. At least 279 children have died since the latest violence escalated in March, compared to a total of 74 last year, the United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement. UNICEF is backing a call by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for a pause in the fighting during the holy month of Ramadan, which begins Thursday. Peace talks, sponsored by the U.N. and including Saudi Arabia, are being held in Geneva. "It is the important start towards the return to a political process," Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed said Tuesday. "Let us be realistic; it will be a difficult path, but the important issue is that we start addressing the crisis in all its dimensions, determination and willingness and that we start doing this now." Yemen has been torn by fighting between the Houthi Shiite militiamen and government forces loyal to President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi fled the capital, Sanaa, in March. Iran has been accused of backing the Houthi rebels -- something it denies. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in a bid to counteract what it sees as Iranian influence in the region.

            <cabecalho>Al-Wuhayshi's death deprives al Qaeda of a heavyweight - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Nasir al-Wuhayshi didn't fit the stereotype of a terrorist leader. But he also had an understated charisma and inspired awe and deep loyalty among fighters</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Nasir al-Wuhayshi didn't fit the stereotype of a terrorist leader: He was slight, quiet and had an impish sense of humor, according to one of the few Westerners to have met him. But he also had an understated charisma and inspired awe and deep loyalty among al Qaeda fighters in Yemen. Even though he was only in his late 30s, al-Wuhayshi had more than 20 years of experience fighting jihad and had been close to Osama bin Laden. To many observers, his death is the most significant individual blow to al Qaeda since the killing of militant preacher Anwar al-Awlaki (also in Yemen) four years ago. Morten Storm, a Danish informant for Western intelligence who got access to al-Wuhayshi early in 2012, describes him as "one of the last al Qaeda heavyweights, a fighter's fighter." Al-Wuhayshi had fashioned al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, into the only affiliate capable of both taking territory on its home turf and planning sophisticated attacks overseas. The "underpants" bomb designed to bring down a U.S. airliner over Detroit, the plot to blow up planes with printer bombs (which very nearly succeeded), a complex attack on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen, the Paris attack on Charlie Hebdo this year: They and many other conspiracies were hatched by AQAP from its redoubt in Yemen's mountainous southeast. To his admirers, al-Wuhayshi also seemed untouchable. Once bin Laden's personal secretary in Afghanistan, he returned to Yemen and was jailed -- only to escape in a massive breakout of al Qaeda prisoners in 2006. Under his leadership, al Qaeda in Yemen soon became al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and attracted Saudi recruits -- some of them former detainees at Guantanamo Bay. There were rumors that al-Wuhayshi was killed in a U.S. missile strike in December 2009, but he soon resurfaced. He was also seen as the brains behind an ambitious plan to attack U.S. diplomatic missions in 2013 -- one that led to the temporary closure of some 20 U.S. embassies. Al-Wuhayshi contributed to this aura with a brazenly open appearance in front of dozens of jihadists in a video released last year. Apparently oblivious to the danger of a missile strike, he tells the group: "We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!" Despite opportunities at home, AQAP was still very much focused on distant enemies. The United States recognized al-Wuhayshi's significance in declaring him a "Specially Designated Global Terrorist" in 2010, offering a reward of $10 million for information on his whereabouts.  At a time when al Qaeda is being challenged across the Middle East by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, al-Wuhayshi was a totemic figure as leader of the group's most effective and resilient affiliate. ISIS may have become the destination of choice for a new generation of militants, but al-Wuhayshi rejected it unequivocally, swearing a personal oath, or bayat, of allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri and being appointed the group's second in command globally. In statements late last year, AQAP criticized ISIS for distributing videos of beheadings. And one of its leading ideologues, Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari, complained that "our brothers in the Islamic State ... surprised us with several steps, including their announcement of the caliphate (and) they announced the expansion of the caliphate in a number of countries where they have no governance," Yemen no doubt included. Al Qaeda's second in command killed in Yemen strike; successor named Even so, one very influential Yemeni cleric has been calling on AQAP to pledge its allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. And ISIS has continued to establish its presence in Yemen undaunted, with massive suicide bombings of Houthi gatherings in the capital last year and further attacks against Houthi forces since. Its numbers may be in the dozens there, compared with AQAP's in the many hundreds -- according to Yemeni officials -- but it has made its mark.  If al-Zawahiri is the figurehead, a distant chairman of the board, al-Wuhayshi was the dynamic chief executive officer. Not that his death will lead to AQAP's liquidation. Among al Qaeda groups -- and despite successful drone attacks against several of its leading figures -- AQAP has considerable stamina. Even so, al-Wuhayshi's demise deprives the group of the leading light in a tight nucleus that has run the organization since its inception, a cohort that according to a study of AQAP by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point "avoided the strategic mistakes that commonly defeat jihadists elsewhere, keeping AQAP relevant in a highly competitive domestic and international environment." One of the few left in that cohort is now al-Wuhayshi's successor: military commander Qasim al-Raymi, considered the operational brains of the franchise. He has probably been involved in every major decision of the last decade, but is only 37. Like al-Wuhayshi, he was also designated by the U.S. in 2010, with a reward of $5 million attached. Al-Raymi comes from an area near Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. He escaped jail with al-Wuhayshi nine years ago and was planning sabotage attacks against oil installations within months. Some Saudi officials see him as more dangerous than al-Wuhayshi in terms of his ability to plan attacks. He is thought to have conceived the plan to assassinate then-head of Saudi intelligence Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, in 2009. Al Qaeda's chief bomb-maker, Ibrahim al-Asiri, engineered the device, which was inserted into his brother's rectum but failed to kill bin Nayef. Al-Raymi is important for another reason: He is Yemeni, in a group that includes Saudis and other foreigners. "Removing this top tier of Yemenis while leaving the group's foreign leaders in place would be a catastrophic loss for the group, in effect stripping it of the local credibility and strategic guidance essential to endure in Yemen," concludes the Combating Terrorism Center. Opinion: A death trap for al Qaeda leaders? Most counterterrorism analysts expect al-Raymi to keep AQAP in the al Qaeda fold, but whether he will have the ability to dent ISIS' budding appeal in Yemen is an open question. He does not have links to "AQ Central" as deep as al-Wuhayshi's, but he was also in al Qaeda's Afghan camps as a teenager in the 1990s. Al-Raymi -- like his predecessor -- sees the war in Yemen as part of "America's broader war against Islam, one in which the United States used Muslim forces to advance its objectives in Iraq, Pakistan and Palestine," according to the Combating Terrorism Center report. He has been excoriating about the drone campaign's effect on Yemen's civilian population. One tidbit on al-Raymi: He may have a blond Croatian wife. In 2009, Morten Storm, an informant for Western intelligence, found and introduced by video a young woman called Irena Horak to al-Awlaki. The cleric was then living in a remote area of Marib province and apparently was desperate for a Western wife. Horak renamed herself Aminah, flew to Yemen and married him. When al-Awlaki was killed, Western intelligence officials told Storm that Aminah may have become al-Raymi's wife. There was even a plan to track down al-Raymi by sending a bugged makeup box to Aminah.  AQAP's fortunes will in great part depend on whether Yemen as a state falls into the abyss or is somehow patched back together thanks to international mediation. The group has flourished since the Houthi takeover of the capital and other parts of central Yemen. As a Shia sect, the Houthis inspire loathing among militant Sunnis, a useful recruiting tool for AQAP. For a while in 2013 and 2014, AQAP was forced onto its back foot as a reorganized Yemeni military, supported by U.S. intelligence and drone warfare, went on the offensive. But the chaos of the last nine months has allowed al Qaeda to re-establish itself in provinces like Shabwa and Hadramaut in the south. It is now one of several actors -- the Houthis, loyalists to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, southern secessionists, the Saudis -- in a complex battlefield of shifting alliances. AQAP has enjoyed the ungoverned space provided by Yemen's implosion, essentially taking over towns like the port of Mukalla in the south while retaining hideouts used by bomb-maker al-Asiri and his apprentices. It has benefited from another mass prison break and the withdrawal of U.S. Special Forces from a base in eastern Yemen. But al-Wuhayshi's death -- along with drone strikes against several other AQAP figures in recent months -- shows that the U.S. retains reach and intelligence in Yemen. And to some analysts, al-Raymi and al-Asiri are the last surviving "big" players in AQAP. So al-Raymi inherits a mantle where risk and opportunity are in almost equal measure. But he certainly knows the territory. Bergen: Will whack-a-mole strategy succeed vs. terrorists?

            <descricao>Al Qaeda's second in command, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, has been killed in a drone strike in Yemen, dealing a heavy setback to the terrorist organization.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Al Qaeda's second in command, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, has been killed in a drone strike in Yemen, dealing a heavy setback to the leadership of the international terrorist group. Al-Wuhayshi was the top leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, one of the most dangerous and dynamic branches of the jihadist network. His death is "the biggest blow against al Qaeda since the death of (Osama) bin Laden," said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Al-Wuhayshi was al Qaeda's "leading light" and was one day expected to take over from its current global chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri, said Cruickshank. Two Yemeni security officials told CNN on Monday that al-Wuhayshi was killed Friday in a suspected U.S. drone strike in Yemen's Hadhramaut region. On Tuesday, AQAP released a video statement announcing that its leader and two aides had died. The speaker said that al-Wuhayshi would be succeeded by the group's military chief, Qasm al-Rimi, also known as Abu Hureira al-Sanaani. Opinion: A death trap for al Qaeda leaders?  The U.S. government confirmed al-Wuhayshi's fate Tuesday, calling his death "a major blow to (al Qaeda's) most dangerous affiliate and to al Qaeda more broadly." Al-Wuhayshi "was responsible for the deaths of innocent Yemenis and Westerners, including Americans," U.S. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said. "While AQAP, al Qaeda and their affiliates will remain persistent in their efforts to threaten the United States, our partners and our interests, (al-Wuhayshi's) death removes from the battlefield an experienced terrorist leader and brings us closer to degrading and ultimately defeating those groups." Al-Wuhayshi, known as al Qaeda's crown prince, was a charismatic figure who was adored by many of the terrorist group's jihadist fighters. In a video that surfaced in April of last year, al-Wuhayshi appeared brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen, the impoverished nation that the organization uses as a base. In a speech to the group, he makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying: "We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!" The video showed what looked like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. Al-Wuhayshi's death deprives al Qaeda of a dynamic heavyweight  Originally from Yemen, al-Wuhayshi assumed command of AQAP in 2009. He'd escaped a Yemeni prison in 2006 and had previously worked as a personal secretary for Osama bin Laden. His successor is also seen as a formidable leader. "Qasm al-Rimi was considered the brains of the operation," Cruickshank said. "For more than a decade, he's really been at the helm of the military side of things for AQAP but also planning their large international operations." The leadership change is expected to bring "a degree of continuity," he said, noting that al-Wuhayshi and al-Rimi were believed to have worked very closely together. April: American mouthpiece for al Qaeda killed  Al-Wuhayshi's death comes at a time when AQAP appears to have been thriving amid the recent turmoil in Yemen. The group has been "expanding the territory they control, taking advantage of political chaos," Cruickshank said. AQAP has been feeding off anger among Sunni tribes in Yemen over the advances made by the predominantly Shiite Houthi rebels who overthrew the Yemeni government earlier this year. Adding to the violence and destruction, a Saudi-led coalition has been bombing the Houthis and their allies in an effort to restore the deposed government. AQAP has exploited the unrest to seize more turf, including the port city of Al Mukalla, where it freed hundreds of inmates from a prison in April. The Yemeni security officials told CNN that the drone strike that killed al-Wuhayshi took place in southern Al Mukalla. What is AQAP?  Yemen's descent into chaos prompted the United States to pull out its Special Operations forces based in the country in March, raising fears that its counterterrorism efforts against AQAP would be hobbled. But al-Wuhayshi's death and an airstrike in April that killed a senior AQAP leader show that Yemen is no haven for the terrorist group. U.S. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, told CNN on Monday that the terrorist leader's death would hurt al Qaeda, but he stressed that the jihadist network still poses a threat. "This is a long, difficult struggle that we're engaged in, and it's going to require all kinds of tools," he said. News of al-Wuhayshi's death emerged days after U.S. planes carried out a strike inside Libya, purportedly killing a key terror figure in North Africa. The target was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran Islamist fighter who is blind in one eye and affiliated with al Qaeda in North Africa, a U.S. official told CNN. The Libyan government said Belmokhtar was killed in the weekend strike, something that U.S. officials have not confirmed. Senior AQAP leader Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi killed CNN's Dana Ford, Hamdi Alkhshali, Salim Essad, Merieme Arif, Barbara Starr, Greg Botelho, Jomana Karadsheh and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Iraqi Sunni volunteer soldiers graduate, but morale low - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Training Iraqi Sunni soldiers is a core part of the fight against ISIS. But at a recent graduation ceremony for volunteers, signs were less than promising.</descricao>
            <corpo>Al-Taqaddum Air Base, Habbaniya, Iraq (CNN)"They're over there," the provincial official said, winking and motioning with his head toward a group of men in khaki uniforms huddled around a black Humvee. "But don't tell anyone I told you." We had come to Anbar Province's Al-Taqaddum Air Base to attend a graduation ceremony for Sunni volunteers who had finished a training course. We hoped that during our visit to the run-down base, which was built by the British, expanded under Saddam Hussein, then upgraded by the Americans, we might get the chance to speak to U.S. military advisers stationed here. Upon arrival, an Iraqi official told journalists the Americans wouldn't take part in the ceremony, and wouldn't give any interviews -- so I approached them as soon as I saw them. "We're glad you could make it here," said the oldest of the group of Americans, shaking my hand. "How was your trip here?" asked another with smile. "Hope it wasn't too difficult." "This is an important occasion, and it's important for you to be here," the older officer said.  Small talk was the order of the day. Questions about what they were doing here, how long they had been here, what exactly their mission was, were deflected with friendly smiles and short, polite answers. Last week, the Obama administration announced it will send up to 450 U.S. troops to Iraq, destined for Al-Taqaddum, to bolster the training mission -- specifically to help train Sunni fighters. It was a decision taken after the fall last month of Ramadi, the third provincial to be captured by ISIS after Mosul and Tikrit in June last year. (Tikrit was subsequently recaptured by Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, in April.) READ MORE: U.S. authorizes up to 450 additional troops to Iraq Eventually I was able to extract a bit more information. These men were training the Iraqi army officers who were then training the Sunni volunteers. They hadn't actually begun this task, however. And the task will not be easy. The volunteers seemed to range in age from late teens to close to 60. They wore a mish-mash of uniforms and boots, while their marching during the ceremony was, shall we say, casual. The searing midday heat and blast-furnace wind might have taken a spring out of their step -- they had been out in the sun for about an hour before the hour-long ceremony even began.  The ceremony itself was an odd affair. On one side of the parade ground was a large tent providing shade to dozens of provincial officials, local leaders, officers and other hangers on. Little tables before the seats in the front held little bottles of cold water and boxes of tissues. On the far side were the volunteers, standing at ease in the blazing sun. When the speeches began, there was no loudspeaker, so they heard not a peep of the many words of praise that were thrown in their direction. Before all the speeches had been delivered by the various dignitaries, the volunteers walked off the parade ground. I've been to plenty such events over the years‚Äîceremonies for new policemen, sailors, soldiers, etc. Normally they are pretty dull affairs, where everyone has good things to say, and then leaves. This time it was different.  I first spoke with Mahmoud Abid, a man in his early twenties. How was the training, I asked. Was it useful? "Yes, yes, very useful," he shrugged, but quickly got around to what he really wanted to talk about. "The weapons they gave us are useless," he said, patting his AK-47 assault rifle. "We can't fight ISIS with this. We need heavier weapons, Russian or American weapons." He also said he had yet to be paid after four months of training. READ MORE: Iraqi veteran who fled Mosul a year ago -- 'ISIS will never leave my city'  Mahmoud's comrade, Hamdallah, after adjusting his AK-47 on his chest, explained that after six months he also had not been paid. The ceremony was to be followed by distribution of salaries, I told him, so you will be paid. "Yes, for just one month, not the other months," he replied. These are young men, I thought. Perhaps one of the tribal leaders who had watched the ceremony might have a better idea of what was really going on. Shaikh Abdallah Al-Issawi is from Amariyat Al-Fallouja, a nearby Sunni town that has resisted ISIS for 18 months. A tall man in a traditional robe or dishdasha, and headscarf, he radiated the authority of a man who leads other men in battle. Is it true these volunteers haven't been paid in months? I asked. "Until now, they haven't been paid one dinar," he said. "Even if they've been well-trained, they're disenchanted. Their families can't buy a bag of flour, a gallon of gas or a kilo of tomatoes." All the while, he added, "officials and officers come to this base, promise this and that, and nothing changes."  On this day they did get paid. Hundreds lined up outside a ramshackle building, waiting their turn at a table where, after a signature and a thumbprint, they were given a stack of red bills -- 750,000 Iraqi dinars, just over $560, a month's pay. No one mentioned back pay. Deducted beforehand was 150,000 Iraqi dinars to cover the cost of food. Next to the table we met 58-year-old Hamid Abbas, wearing not a uniform but a dishdasha. "If I'm not going to fight, who will?" he asked CNN producer Hamdi Al-Khshali. He has the will, but like so many others he complained he didn't have the way to fight. In addition to having to pay for their own food, many said they had bought their own uniforms and boots.  Was all this the result of administrative confusion or, as is often suggested, deliberate short-changing of the Sunni population by the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad, which fears weapons for the Sunnis will quickly fall into the hands of ISIS? It was the former, Anbar Governor Suhaib Al-Rawi told me. "The Iraqi state is very bureaucratic when it comes to carrying out orders." Later I caught up again with the American advisers. Lips still tight, they didn't give much up. How many times have you been in Iraq? I asked the older officer, who never volunteered his name. "More times than I can count," he responded with a sigh. And what do you think about the fact that you're here again? "If I were to answer that question," he replied curtly, "the answer would last six hours."  </corpo>

            <descricao>The U.S. military program to train moderate Syrian rebels in Turkey and Jordan to fight ISIS has run into difficulties that are slowing the effort.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)The U.S. military program to train so-called moderate Syrian rebels in Turkey and Jordan to fight ISIS has run into a number of difficulties that are slowing the effort down, Pentagon officials now openly acknowledge. Of the 6,000 Syrians who have volunteered to be part of the program, less than 200 have begun training. One of the factors causing the problems, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren, has been the "exfiltration" of qualified fighters from Syria -- the very risky process of getting them out of Syria to the training sites. None of those at the training sites has yet completed the program. READ: Carter, Dempsey paint bleak picture of Iraq situation The Pentagon effort was aimed at bringing rebels fighters not associated with ISIS or Al Qaeda affiliates out of Syria and then training them in skills they could use to go back home and defend their areas against ISIS. The hope was that this effort would train significantly larger numbers of fighters than a longstanding covert effort by the CIA to train rebels. Of the 6,000 rebels who volunteered to be in the Defense Department program, some 4,000 are still waiting to be fully vetted by the U.S. Part of the process is getting assurances the fighters, once they've gone through training, will return to their towns and villages to fight ISIS rather than the Assad regime. Some 1,500 of the 6,000 have passed through the vetting process, while about 500 have been turned down for a variety of reasons. The U.S. plan had been to train about 3,000 during the rest of 2015 and about 5,400 every 12 months after that. "The Syria train-and-equip program is even more challenging than the Iraq train-and-equip program," Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday. "We are trying to recruit and identify people that ... can be counted on -- that is, to fight, to have the right mindset and ideology," Carter said, emphasizing fighters could not be aligned with groups like ISIS and must be willing to take actions to fight ISIS. "It turns out to be very hard to identify people who meet both of those criteria," he said. The U.S. is also still struggling to decide what responsibility it will take for these fighters once they are sent back to their homes in Syria to fight ISIS. "I believe we have some obligation to support them and protect them, including supply them," Carter said, adding that he is aware that there are concerns that weapons provided during training could be "diverted." "These constraints that we put on ourselves, which are perfectly understandable, do progressively limit the number of inductees into the program," he said. "And that's proving (to be) the thing that limits the growth of the program. We have enough training sites and so forth for them. For now, we don't have enough trainees to fill them." This comes at a time when the Assad regime may be under the greatest strain to maintain its power because of both ISIS's ability to take territory and gains made by rebels groups. READ: House votes to keep U.S. troops deployed against ISIS At the same hearing, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed that that very subject came up in discussions during his recent trip to Israel to meet with top military officials there. "That was the purpose of my trip to the region, actually, was to discuss with regional partners a scenario in which the regime would either collapse," he said, or Assad "would depart for one reason or another. Dempsey said that nations in the region believe the most likely near-term scenario is the Assad regime could go on the defensive "and limit its protection of the Alawite Shiite and some of the minority groups, leaving the rest of Syria essentially ungoverned, or governed in ways that ... wouldn't be positive for the region in the near term." U.S. defense officials told CNN that all of Syria's bordering countries, including Israel, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon are concerned that a precipitous collapse of the Assad regime could lead to a security and refugee crisis on their borders. U.S. intelligence officials have noted for the last couple of months that Assad's forces have appeared increasingly exhausted, units are undermanned and in some cases the regime may not be paying its bills to weapons suppliers in Russia.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Al Jazeera said Monday that a journalist that Egypt convicted in absentia years ago and was detained Saturday has been released without charge.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)An Al Jazeera Arabic reporter detained in Berlin this weekend was released Monday. The network reported on air that Ahmed Mansour was released without charge. The journalist was on his way Saturday to Qatar, where Al Jazeera has its headquarters, when authorities apprehended him. An Egyptian court convicted Mansour in absentia, accusing him of torturing a lawyer in Cairo's Tahrir Square in 2011 during the revolution. Mansour was sentenced to 15 years. In a statement, Mansour said the German officers told him the arrest was at the request of Egyptian authorities. After the journalist was sentenced last year, Egypt asked the international police body Interpol to seek Mansour's arrest, but according to Al Jazeera, the request was denied. "I informed (German police) that the global police organization has rejected Egypt's request and that I have this document from the Interpol to prove that I am not wanted in any charge," Mansour said. The journalist said the charges against him and his conviction were "fabricated," and Al Jazeera characterized them as "a flimsy attempt at character assassination." German police confirmed that a journalist was arrested at Berlin Tegel Airport on Saturday afternoon but declined to give the detainee's name. Germany's federal police also cited an Interpol request as the reason for the arrest. It is not the first time Egyptian authorities have gone after Al Jazeera journalists. Three journalists -- Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed -- spent more than a year behind bars. They were arrested in Egypt in December 2013, accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and broadcasting footage that portrayed the regime falsely with the intention of bringing it down. They have consistently denied the charges or any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, saying they were only doing their jobs. Earlier this year, Greste was freed and deported to his native Australia, and Fahmy and Mohamed were granted bail pending a retrial. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>Many weapons have been deployed against the terrorist group ISIS.  Now, a comedian in Saudi Arabia is adding a new weapon to the arsenal: satire.</descricao>
            <corpo>Dubai (CNN)Many weapons have been deployed against the terrorist group ISIS -- conventional arms, targeted airstrikes and Iranian-backed Shia militias among them. Now, a comedian in Saudi Arabia is adding another weapon to the arsenal: satire. Humor may not be the first thing that comes to mind when the topic is ISIS, a group known for mass rape and torture, and for posting videos of its members beheading captives or burning them alive. Not a lot of yuks in that, it wouldn't seem. But into the fray has waded Saudi comedian Nasser Al Qasabi, armed only with a keen wit and a rare bit of courage.  The Arab world has gone mad over Al Qasabi's 45-minute satirical TV series "Selfie" -- which is shown by MBC, the Middle East Broadcasting Center -- and discussion of the show is all the rage on social media. Many people support the comedian. But, as shown by hashtags such as #SlaughterNasserAlQasabi and #NasserAlQasabi'sheadwanted, not everyone is amused. Al Qasabi started the show off with a bang. The first episode of "Selfie" was about an artist who quit the music industry to repent and become a cleric. The satire skewered untrustworthy clerics and extremist religious figures in Saudi Arabia. Many Saudis were outraged. Some called Al Qasabi an apostate. And one Saudi cleric was so unimpressed with Al Qasabi's satirical approach to religion that he took to Twitter. "Al Qasabi is mocking Muslim clergy, could he possibly mock any Shi'a clerics?! Oh I swear it is people like him who are reason that extremism and radicalism spread!" Thus chastened -- not! -- the comedian really waded into a minefield with show No. 2, a "mockathon" of ISIS. The episode followed a Saudi father who traveled to Syria in search of his son, who had joined ISIS. But the father ended up involved with ISIS as well. Throughout the episode, Al Qasabi touched on topics such as ISIS' torture and execution methods, which include lashing and decapitation. He also makes fun of the group's infamous "sex jihad," in which fighters comfort and purify themselves after a hard day's killing by having sexual relations -- not a practice warmly endorsed by more traditional Islamic clerics. The episode ended with the son putting a knife to his father's neck, preparing to slaughter him.  Many people applauded Al Qasabi for his daring approach. But others bombarded his Twitter account and social media pages with curses and threats. The comedian also received threats from ISIS-related social media accounts promising to "give him what he deserves." But Al Qasabi kept his cool. "My twitter account is overflowing with those cursing at me and threatening me with all sorts of curse words and threats," he tweeted. "I tell them all, stay calm and Ramadan Kareem, the show is still in its very beginning!" "Ramadan kareem," a greeting, can be translated as "Have a bountiful Ramadan." Ramadan, which is underway, is the holiest month in the Islamic calendar. Perhaps it all seems a bit frivolous in the face of ISIS' guns and sabers. But experts say that's not so. In an article this month in The American Interest, former U.S. State Department official Michael Rubin, who is now at the American Enterprise Institute, said humor should be one of the tools in the fight against radical Islamists. "Islamists cannot handle free thinking in the best of times, but ridicule is their kryptonite, for it shows that the would-be caliphs have no clothes," Rubin wrote. "Hence it should be an essential part of any strategy." CNN's Don Melvin in London contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Egypt: Dog mummies in catacombs estimated in millions - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>An estimated 8 million mummified animals, mostly dogs, were laid in the catacombs of Anubis, a high figure that surprises even veteran Egyptologists.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For centuries, dogs have been humans' loyal, domesticated companions. They've been wild animals, doing what's needed to survive. And in ancient Egypt, they served as bridges to the afterlife, with the hope that they'd intercede with the god Anubis on their owner's behalf. But only now is it becoming known the extent to which dogs served this latter role -- 8 million times over. That is the number of dead animals, most of them dogs, estimated to have laid in the catacombs of Anubis around Saqqara, one of Egypt's most historic and oft-visited sites, according to a group of British researchers. While such mass burials aren't unprecedented, given the numerous animal cults of ancient Egypt, this one's scale makes it unique. "We're very pleased and somewhat surprised by the results," the project's director Paul Nicholson from Cardiff University's School of History, Archaeology and Religion said Saturday. "We hadn't expected that there would be so many animals, and it opens up a new series of questions." One question that experts can at least partially answer is why an Egyptian might have brought an animal, dead or alive, to such a place. Nicholson, who has been studying animal cults since the 1990s, explains that people wouldn't have come simply to kill or even bury an animal so much as allow it to move onto a different plane. A dog, especially, would be a good fit because it might then interact with Anubis, an ancient Egyptian god of the dead depicted with the body of a man and head of a dog or, its close relative, a jackal. "The important thing was to provide a representation of the god with a fitting burial," Nicholson said. "It's not some sort of blood sacrifice. It's a religious act that's done for the best possible motive." The animal's owner would hope that, by doing this, "some good will come to you," the Wales-based Egyptologist noted. "Maybe you're hoping that the animal will help someone in your family who has died recently (so that) Anubis will take care of that (relative)." Just as Egyptians' view of Anubis, and dogs, has been common knowledge for some time, so too have the dog catacombs of Anubis. This includes a map from 1897 that shows their location clearly marked. Still, most of the focus was on temples outside the catacomb. Until, that is, Nicholson's team -- with the support and help from Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities and sponsorship from National Geographic -- began working on the Saqqara site around 2009 and began exploring deep inside. They found a series of unadorned tunnels, in some cases filled with animal remains and in other cases cleared out. (Nicholson speculated that some may have been taken out for use in fertilizers, as has been done with other animal remains.) Those that they found were wrapped in bandages and mummified, including some with a resin applied. One shouldn't imagine an ornate King Tut, though: They were likely stacked on top of each other and "survived very badly," Nicholson said. "It would be quite difficult to easily find complete, nicely wrapped mummies," he added. "What you have got is the decayed remains of the mummies." To estimate how many there are, the team took a sample and extrapolated from there how many likely filled up the catacomb. One reason the number is so high is because many of the animals were very small; while there some were mature and likely had full lives, Nicholson speculated that some were "being especially bred for the cult." The catacombs are believed to date from between roughly 750 to 30 B.C., up to the time Egypt's society was interacting more and more with those of Europe, including ancient Greece and Rome. A summary of the Cardiff team's findings was published this week in the journal Antiquity. Nicholson and his co-authors, Salima Ikram and Steve Mills, are now working on a more complete study. And the work continues at the Saqqara site, which includes other animal catacombs and many monuments like the step pyramid of Djoser, as well as in laboratories to discover more about the animal remains, such as patterns of sex and age. "We are very curious about where the animals came from," Nicholson said. "We're learning quite a bit about the Egyptians' interactions with animals. It's an exciting thing." Could Egypt's empty animal mummies reveal an ancient scam?  </corpo>

            <descricao>Just picking off the leaders of terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda isn't an effective strategy </descricao>
            <corpo>Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of "Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for bin Laden -- From 9/11 to Abbottabad." (CNN)American counterterrorism officials have had much to celebrate in recent days: the killing of ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in Syria and the trove of "intel" that was taken from his residence by U.S. special forces; the death of the leader of al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, in a drone strike; and the possible death in Libya of Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of a virulent North African jihadist group. But the leadership of these groups is generally replaceable. Consider the case of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was the brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq, the parent organization of ISIS, until he was killed by a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2006. Since then, a number of other leaders from al-Zarqawi's group have been killed, but that did not prevent from ISIS becoming ISIS -- a group that today lords over millions of people and occupies territory in Syria and Iraq that is around the size of the United Kingdom. To be sure, any counterterrorism campaign that eliminates many leaders of a group can have a real impact -- al Qaeda's core group in Pakistan is a shadow of what it once was, in part, because of a deadly campaign of CIA drone strikes that eliminated many of its leaders and middle managers. Yet, if we zoom out to the bigger picture, from Libya on the northern coast of Africa to Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the spaces in which jihadist militant groups can operate have greatly opened up as a result of the early promise of the Arab Spring turning into the grim reality of the Arab winter. The resulting chaotic conditions and weakened states have proven a boon to ISIS and to al Qaeda and its affiliates: -- In Yemen, al Qaeda has taken advantage of the overthrow of the U.S.-backed Hadi government to seize control of large swaths of southern Yemen, including the country's fifth largest city, Mukalla. -- In Libya, jihadist groups including ISIS control about a tenth of the country, according to a senior U.S. government official. -- In Syria, al-Qaeda's local affiliate, the Nusra Front, together with ISIS are now the most powerful groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and each control large sections of the country. -- In Iraq, ISIS controls the second largest city, Mosul, and much of Anbar province, which is about a third of the landmass of the country. What to do about all this is a puzzle because much of Middle East is in the grip of a regional, sectarian civil war fomented by Iran and the Gulf States and is evolving into a Rubik's Cube-like problem that has no good solution, because when you move one piece of the cube it can create both solutions and a new set of problems simultaneously. To get a sense of how complex this Rubik's Cube is: Consider that the United States is training Syrian opposition forces to fight the Iran-backed regime of Bashar al-Assad, while it is also training Iraqi forces of the Iran-backed Iraqi government to fight ISIS. The U.S. therefore is effectively supporting both sides of the wars in Syria and Iraq. Describing problems is always, of course, much easier than solving them, but here are some ideas that can help the U.S. achieve its strategic goals in the Middle East -- dismantling ISIS and al Qaeda and avoiding a long-running sectarian regional civil war: Curtail the foreign fighter flow ISIS is taking around 1,000 casualties a month in U.S.-led airstrikes, yet it's also recruiting around 1,000 "foreign fighters" from around the Muslim world every month, so the military campaign against ISIS is something of a draw. The U.S. should put pressure on Middle Eastern countries, which supply the bulk of the foreign fighters to the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts, to curtail the flow of their nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia has already made some strides in that direction, but this should also be a priority for other Arab governments. Let American soldiers go forward The exact number of U.S. troops in Iraq is not the germane issue right now. It's the constrictive rules of engagement that have been imposed upon them that prevent them from getting "outside the wire" of the bases that they are assigned to. What is needed are rules of engagement that allow U.S. forward air controllers calling in precise airstrikes as well as U.S. advisers embedded with Iraqi troops on the frontlines. Not only will this help to place more accurate air strikes on ISIS positions, but also Iraqi troops with embedded Americans will have better military advice and the comfort of knowing that they will get close American air support if ISIS threatens them. Right now that isn't the case. Step up the air campaign in Syria and Iraq One of the world's experts on counterinsurgency, New America fellow David Kilcullen suggests increasing the tempo of of the air campaign. Kilcullen points out that the average rate of coalition air strikes since last August into Syria and Iraq is about 10 per day, while in the successful air campaign against the Serbs in Kosovo in 1999, it was around 250 per day, suggesting that the U.S.-led coalition can still ratchet up the pressure on ISIS significantly. Resist calls to split Iraq up into Sunnistan, Shiastan and Kurdistan Iraq is a country where many of its citizens are products of Shia-Sunni marriages and cities like Mosul and Baghdad remain mixtures of many ethnic and religious groups. Trying to separate out Iraq into sectarian and ethnic cantons will only fuel the sectarian passions in Iraq and in the region. The model to avoid, albeit on a larger scale, was the disastrous 1947 partition of India into Muslim- and Hindu-majority states in which 1 million people died. If the Iran nuclear deal gets done, use it as leverage to show al-Assad the door Use the goodwill tendered by a deal with Iran to have the Iranians pressure their close ally, al-Assad, to step down, while maintaining much of his regime in place. That way the coalition of Alawites, Christians and other regime supporters will be assured that if al-Assad goes, they won't have to go down with him and will have a stake in some kind of peace deal, rather than fighting to the death. Keep pressure on the Saudis not to resume their counterproductive air campaign in Yemen That campaign had the effect of further fracturing the already-fracturing country, which has benefited al Qaeda.

            <descricao>A church in Israel where Christians believe Jesus fed 5,000 people has been badly damaged by a fire that police say they suspect may have been intentional.</descricao>
            <corpo>Tabgha, Israel (CNN)A church at the site in Israel where Christians believe Jesus fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fish has been badly damaged by arson, police said Thursday. Fires were set off early Thursday in the monastery section of the Church of the Multiplication, in Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Israeli police said. The flames consumed much of the interior of the monastery and destroyed the roof, leaving only charred remains of Bibles and other objects. Graffiti scrawled in red Hebrew lettering on a wall outside the Roman Catholic church read, "Idols will have their heads cut off." Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said she condemned the attack "in the strongest terms." "The State of Israel safeguards the freedom of worship of all faiths and completely rejects any and all attempts to harm it," Hotovely said in a statement, expressing confidence that the perpetrators would be caught.  Police detained 16 Jewish settlers, all of them minors, for questioning over the incident and later released them. The Church of the Multiplication is run by Benedictine monks. The area is one of the most significant in Christianity. The site of the church is near the places where the New Testament says Jesus walked on water and delivered the Sermon on the Mount. The part of the church housing the rock where Jesus is said to have put the five loaves and two fish wasn't damaged in the fire. This is far from the first time a place of worship has been attacked in the region in recent years. Police have said they suspect right-wing Jewish extremists of torching and defacing mosques and churches in the past. Palestinians say not enough is being done to catch those behind the attacks. "Churches and Mosques in all of historic Palestine continue to be targeted by Israeli terrorists who enjoy full impunity from their State," the Palestine Liberation Organization said in a statement following Thursday's fire. CNN's Oren Libermann reported from Tabgha, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Michael Schwartz, Kareem Khadder and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>London (CNN)A member of a British family that went missing last week in the Middle East has made contact, and police said Wednesday the information suggests the father's worst fears may have been realized. The three women and their nine children between the ages of 3 and 15 may have entered Syria, authorities said. The extended family disappeared on a trip from Bradford, in northern England, to Saudi Arabia. They ceased all contact on June 9 and failed to return home on June 11, as expected. Police said that, instead, the mothers and children all boarded a plane for Turkey, which shares a border with Syria.  The husbands of two of the women issued tearful televised pleas Tuesday for the return of their wives and children. But the contact from one of the mothers suggested that the family has crossed the border into Syria, police said. They did not say which mother got in touch, by what means, or whom in the UK she contacted. Police called the information that the family was now in Syria "uncorroborated." "We are extremely concerned for the safety of this family, especially the nine children," said West Yorkshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster. The same group -- all three women and their nine children -- tried to fly to Saudi Arabia earlier this year, but they were stopped for security checks at an airport, the United Kingdom's North East Counter Terrorism Unit said Wednesday. During those security checks, the women told investigators that they intended to go to Saudi Arabia for a religious pilgrimage. Authorities found no legal reason to keep them from traveling, but the group missed its flight because of the checks, the NECTU said. The unit did not provide the date of the first attempt to fly to Saudi Arabia.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35¬∫C and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>Cairo, Egypt (CNN)To the uninitiated, Cairo can be sensory overload at the best of times -- a bewildering snarl of traffic, people and minarets that is next to impossible for the untrained eye to untangle. But beneath all the chaos lies an undeniable charm and beauty. We asked the city's Instagrammers to shine a light -- and a lens -- on the things that make Cairo great. Christina Rizk, a local photographer, took over the @CNN, @CNNTravel and @CNNArabic Instagram accounts this week -- and you also chipped in with your best shots of the Egyptian capital. "A boy sells cotton candy as a television commercial is being filmed just out of shot. The crew's cameras drew a crowd that spilled into this street in downtown." "A woman strolls through Maadi, a leafy Cairo suburb with beautiful buildings that can sometimes seem light years away from the noisy, traffic-clogged streets in the city's center." "A man takes a lunch-break on a sidewalk in downtown #Cairo." "Thursday marked the beginning of Ramadan -- and these lanterns, believed to have originated in Egypt, are an enduring symbol of the Muslim holy month." "Men in Maadi, a quiet suburb in Cairo, buy meat at a butcher shop ahead of Ramadan." "A shop owner prepares to rearrange the window display at his lingerie shop in Maadi." "Captain of our boat." "Party boat passing on the Nile." "A security guard at the entrance of St. Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church in Mar Girgis, also known as the Hanging Church (El Muallaqa).

            <cabecalho>South Korea MERS death toll rises to 23 - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>South Korean officials announced more deaths in the country's MERS outbreak Wednesday, raising the total death toll to 23.</descricao>
            <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)South Korean officials announced one more death in the country's MERS outbreak Friday, raising the total death toll to 24. One new case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was also announced, bringing the total number to 166, according to South Korea's Ministry of Health. The number of people under quarantine in South Korea, both in their own homes or in quarantine facilities, declined from 6,729 to 5,930 The World Health Organization described the MERS outbreak as a "wakeup call," showing that outbreaks can happen anywhere. The WHO has said that the number of new cases "appears to be declining" -- indicating that the outbreak could be slowing down. But it also warned that "all outbreaks are unpredictable" -- especially for new diseases that are not well understood. This week, there had been a sign of a possible return to normalcy, as thousands of schools across South Korea re-opened after closures due to the deadly outbreak. But it came with heightened awareness; children's temperatures were monitored in classrooms and teachers warned students to practice personal hygiene and frequently wash their hands. The WHO had recommended re-opening institutions last week because transmission of the virus had not been linked to schools. The MERS outbreak remains largely confined to health care settings. Should you be worried about MERS?  The outbreak has sparked international concern, stalled the nation's economy and resulted in over 100,000 canceled tourist visits to the country. Korea's department store sales tumbled 16.5% compared with the same period last year and retail shops also decreased 3.4%, according to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The ongoing situation has put Korean authorities under scrutiny for their inability to contain MERS cases and President Park Geun-hye has seen her approval ratings plummet. The spread of MERS in South Korea has remained within healthcare settings, but Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a WHO Assistant Director-General warned that transmission could occur outside of hospitals -- which has occurred before in the Middle East. "Even given that possibility, right now we do not see any evidence of this virus causing sustained transmission in community or sweeping through," he said.  Researchers from the U.S. National Institutes of Health and China's Fudan University have been working on an antibody treatment that could fight MERS. An antibody is a protein that combats pathogens like viruses and bacteria. The antibody treatment has only been through lab and animal tests so far and requires trials on humans before it could be available to MERS patients. While the antibody, named m336, has been effective in animals, it has yet to be tested on MERS patients, said Professor Jiang Shibo from Fudan University. All U.S. drugs are required to have human trials, as there are treatments that work in animals but turn out to be ineffective in people. The human trial process could take three to four years, but experimental treatments can be used if patients and the local government consent. So far, m336 has been considered the most potent of several antibodies that could be used to fight MERS, according to a scientific summary published in the Journals Center for Cancer Research.  Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has recorded five cases of MERS in the past week, the official state-run Saudi press agency said Sunday, citing a weekly Ministry of Health statement. It included one death of a 73-year-old man who died in the city of Turaba and had a pre-existing condition. The strain of coronavirus that causes MERS was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. The man believed to be "patient zero" in the current outbreak in South Korea visited Saudi Arabia in May, along with three other Middle Eastern countries. That 68-year-old patient went from facility-to-facility near or around Seoul before getting properly diagnosed. It triggered the hospital-based transmission of MERS in South Korea. The South Korean outbreak is the largest outside of Saudi Arabia -- nearly 6,000 people remain in quarantine.  In Seoul, Samsung Medical Center -- one of the city's hospitals that has counted many of the nation's MERS cases among its patients and visitors -- announced Sunday that it will suspend all surgical procedures except for emergency surgery "to fully focus on responding to MERS." More than 50 confirmed MERS cases have been traced back to the medical center, according to the center's website. The medical center, located in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district and considered one of the most prominent hospitals in the capital, issued an apology for its handling of MERS. "We sincerely apologize with our heads bent to the people for causing great concern as Samsung Medical Center became the center (of) the spread of MERS," hospital President Song Jae-hoon said. 5 things to know about MERS CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul. Journalists Evonne Liu and Han Sol, and CNN's Kay Guerrero, Kathy Novak and Khushbu Shah contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Blueprint for success against ISIS in Syria and Iraq? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Close cooperation between coalition air support and committed Kurdish troops on the ground seems to be a winning formula in fight against ISIS.</descricao>
            <corpo>Tal Abyad, Syria (CNN)ISIS has been forced from one of its stronghold outposts, a key access point to its self-declared capital, where it was entrenched for two years. And the defeat along a vital stretch of terrain could be a potential blueprint for more military successes against the militants. In freshly-liberated Tal Abyad -- not far from the Syria-Turkey border -- the scars of battle are everywhere, as are ISIS booby traps. ISIS ruled this rural landscape with impunity, fortifying it to defend a vital frontier and a key access point to their capital. The YPG, the Kurdish fighting force, had tried and failed to capture key towns in the past. ISIS would counter each assault with heavy weapons, car bombs and suicide bombers, each time forcing the YPG to retreat. But in the last month, the battlefield dynamics have changed. Coalition airstrikes pounded ISIS fighting positions, taking out the terrorist group's armored vehicles, heavy weapons, headquarters, and other targets, allowing the YPG to barrel through around 80 kilometers (50 miles) of ISIS territory to reach the major prize -- Tal Abyad. The town is the gateway to a crucial border crossing with Turkey. Key position The combination of coalition power in the air and a committed force on the ground was so effective that ISIS fighters rapidly retreated. ISIS blew up a bridge, and put up a fierce, but brief, fight -- and then drew back. The Kurdish force had estimated it would take them weeks to defeat ISIS in Tal Abyad. In the end, it happened in two days. YPG leaders on the ground tell us that the effectiveness of the assault was thanks to direct coordination between the coalition and their upper command. "When the coalition against ISIS was formed, we were the only force that was committed in the fight against ISIS," said Bilal Rojava, the YPG commander overseeing the Tal Abyad front. "The coalition forces saw this and coordinated with us." That coordination began during the battle for Kobani last fall, and has developed since. Now, the drive to Tal Abyad is scattered with the carcasses of ISIS armored vehicles and the remains of its defensive positions. Buildings once occupied by ISIS, the walls still etched with crude renditions of its feared flag and Quranic inscriptions, lie abandoned. Cross-hair targets spray-painted on the walls of a former ISIS base are peppered with bullet holes. Huge dirt berms that blocked the road have been cleared to allow vehicles to pass. There are underground tunnels, so that ISIS fighters could move undetected, around one village we are taken through. The tunnels -- clearly dug out by heavy machines -- are about a meter wide and high enough to easily stand in. Metal sheets form the roof, covered in a thick layer of dirt, are hard to detect with the naked eye. But they are not thick enough to fool the thermal cameras the coalition has at its disposal. Well-equipped force Inside Tal Abyad, ISIS' seemingly endless supply of armaments is evident. In the back of a mosque named for former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the YPG is clearing out an ISIS bomb-making factory. The flatbed of a truck is half-filled with artillery rounds waiting to be hauled off. There are large artillery rounds, detonation caps, and plastic bags of white sticky powder -- a low grade explosive. A tailor-turned-YPG weapons specialist tells us the white powder is a key element in ISIS's notorious and unending suicide bombs. The YPG is still clearing out towns and villages from booby-traps and mines. In one village, we hear an explosion in the distance. The local commander takes off to determine the cause, returning to tell us that they were from explosives ISIS left behind. READ MORE: ISIS' child soldiers: What will happen to 'cubs of the caliphate?' Booby traps In Tal Abyad, a building is off limits. ISIS is known to booby trap buildings, and the YPG commander tells us not to touch the door. Through the closed gate and hazy windows one can barely see into the guard house, but stacked against its back wall are makeshift bombs with strands of detonation cord snaking out of them. Throughout the ruined town and surrounding countryside, there is evidence of how well armed ISIS is. Its arsenal has been massively enhanced by battlefield gains that began in Mosul and spanned over huge swaths of Iraq. Even the committed YPG had been struggling to beat ISIS's defenses -- until the airstrikes began. "If the coalition strikes, and there is no force on the ground, there would be no real impact on ISIS. And if we advanced without coalition strikes, we would not have advanced this fast," Bilal said. This is perhaps the formula the U.S. wants to implement. Backed by coalition airstrikes, an effective and reliable partner on the ground can succeed in defeating ISIS. But the battlefield is vast, and in this complex region with competing interests, a blueprint for success is hardly easy to replicate.

            <corpo>(CNN)Almost four times as many children have died in the past 10 weeks as a result of the conflict in Yemen as were killed in the whole of 2014, according to UNICEF. At least 279 children have died since the latest violence escalated in March, compared to a total of 74 last year, the United Nations Children's Fund said in a statement. Over the same 10 weeks, 402 were injured -- with 244 injured last year, the statement said. Some children have been drawn directly into the fighting between armed groups in Yemen. UNICEF said 318 children have been recruited and used to man checkpoints or carry arms this year -- double last year's number. "Children continue to be killed, maimed or recruited to fight," said Julien Harneis, UNICEF's representative in Yemen. "They should be safely learning in school, not trying to escape bullets on the front lines."  UNICEF is backing a call by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for a pause in the fighting during the holy month of Ramadan, which begins Thursday. Yemen has been torn by fighting between the Houthi Shiite militiamen and government forces loyal to President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi fled the capital, Sanaa, in March. Iran has been accused of backing the Houthi rebels -- something it denies. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes against the Houthi rebels in a bid to counteract what it sees as Iranian influence in the region.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Kurdish fighters claimed Tuesday to have taken the strategic Syrian town of Tal Abyad from ISIS. The town is close to the border with Turkey, about 310 miles (500 kilometers) northeast of Damascus, and lies on a main road to Raqqa, the city ISIS considers to be its capital. Fighting between the Kurdish forces and ISIS went on until dawn Tuesday, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the Kurds had taken "full control" of the town. The Observatory said at least 40 members of the terrorist group were killed as they tried to run into another town in the area. The town's loss will probably cut off an important ISIS supply route. The strategic advance comes a day after the Kurdish YPG, or People's Protection Units, captured the Syrian side of a Turkish border crossing at Akcakale. ISIS -- or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a terrorist group whose members are predominately Sunni -- is trying to establish a caliphate in the Middle East. It has become known for beheading captives and posting videos of the killings online. Kurdish fighters have already taken about 50 towns and villages from ISIS, Miami Herald columnist Frida Ghitis, quoting the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, wrote Monday in an opinion piece for CNN. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali in Baghdad contributed to this report. CNN's Larry Register and Khushbu Shah also contributed. </corpo>

            <descricao>Blood bags made from health-clinic condoms and scrap metal turned into machine guns. Welcome to Wakaliwood.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Bisaso Dauda isn't your typical prop maker. Today, he's creating a full-sized helicopter using scrap metal. As he works away in Wakaliga, one of the poorer suburbs just outside of Kampala, Uganda, he tinkers with a diesel engine to help spin the rotors. Next, he'll build a tank, then a submarine. Welcome to Wakaliwood. Wakaliwood is the brainchild of self-taught director Isaac Nabwaana, who launched his own amateur production company, Ramon Film Productions, in 2005. Since then, he has seen trailers for his films go viral (the clip for the action movie Who Killed Captain Alex? garnered almost 2.4 million views on YouTube). He is 42-years old, and has made over 40 films in the past decade, all on a budget of less than $200. He gets creative. Machine guns are made from scrap metal, bullets carved from wood, and fake blood bursts out of bags made from free condoms sourced at the local health clinic. Nabwaana's love of film began in childhood. "I used to draw comics and my brothers would tell me what happened in the films -- Rambo is chasing Chuck Norris -- and I would draw it." It wasn't until he was 32 that Nabwaana attempted to make his own movie. "I didn't know how to write a script so the scenes I'd film weren't connecting," he recalls. A partnership with an actor who had written a play and needed Nabwaana's help to film it provided the director with his first opportunity to learn how to string a story together.  It says something about Nabwaana's ambition that in addition to launching his own production company, he's also coined the name for an entire movie industry. Wakaliwood might not have the resources of Hollywood, the glamor of Bollywood or the reach of Nollywood -- it is not even the official film industry in Uganda which is the little-known Ugawood. But Nabwaana's passion for film and his eagerness to teach others is already spawning other film stars. "Western and Nigerian movies are popular but here but we have to teach our people to watch Ugandan films. People don't believe our films can be good, until we show them. Now even universities are sending their students to do internships here," he says. But the road has not been smooth for Nabwaana, who went from making bricks to making films. Some of the challenges he faces are common to all filmmakers (raising finance comes top of that list), while others are unique to making movies in a developing country. Nabwaana speaks of the need for government support and investment in Uganda's film industry. He notes that the businesses that exist in other regions to support movie making -- the prop shops, actors' agencies, location scouts and so on -- simply don't exist in Uganda. Nabwaana had reached out to the army to borrow a chopper ("it didn't even have to fly," he tells me) but got nowhere. Then there's the constant power outages, the lack of parts to build stronger computers (an aim for the near future is to make high-definition movies) and rampant piracy. Without a distributor, the actors and actresses, sometimes in full costume, double as door-to-door salespeople, hawking the films as soon as they come out. This grassroots approach means news of a new film spreads fast by word of mouth. "People are calling me up from [other regions of Uganda] asking me for more films. It is the audience that has made me famous."  Ramon Productions is named after Nabwaana's great grandmothers, Rachel and Monica, as is the first of the three children he has with wife, Harriet Nakasuga. Nakasuga also works as an editor for the company and Nabwaana smiles as he details all the things she helps out with. "Sometimes I work late at night," he explains. "Harriet is always here." The newest member of that family is American Alan Hofmanis. The program director for the Lake Placid Film Festival saw the Who Killed Captain Alex? trailer in 2011. After visiting Nabwaana seven times, Hofmanis sold his belongings and moved to Wakaliga in 2014 to help Nabwaana realize his vision. And it seems they are well on their way. A Kickstarter campaign to raise $160 for the film Tebaatusasula: EBOLA exceeded its target by more than 8,000%, bringing in more than $13,000. That money will be spent on shooting a film in HD and providing daily meals, health and dental care for their crew of volunteers and their families.

            <cabecalho>Who is the 2,000-year-old 'sleeping beauty'? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Anthropologists have uncovered the grave of a 2,000 year old skeleton curled up on her side. Who was this' well-loved' lady?</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It was the Queen of Sheba that first drew Louise Schofield -- an archaeologist and former curator at the British Museum -- to the Gheralta plateau in northern Ethiopia. She'd heard tell of a 20-foot stone stele carved with an inscription and a symbol often linked to the biblical queen: a sun and crescent moon. "The story of the Queen of Sheba has a central place in the heart of all Ethiopians, so I became interested in the story myself," she recalls (Sheba is thought to be located in parts of Ethiopia). It was this initial visit that ultimately led her to discover the 2,000-year-old remains of a character she fondly refers to as "sleeping beauty." The grave was discovered at the stone stele, in an area that was once part of the ancient kingdom of Aksum, which today encompasses Ethiopia and Eritrea. Inside, Schofield's team found the skeleton of a woman posed in a resting position, with her chin laid gently on one hand. A Roman-era bronze mirror was placed before her face. The corpse was surrounded with glass vessels (to catch the tears of the dead), as well as a bronze cosmetics spoon and a lump of kohl eyeliner. "She must have been very wealthy, and probably well-loved to be placed in this position, and judging by all the items of finery around her," surmised Schofield. The dig also uncovered several other graves, all of which had several bodies buried beneath. In some, she found the remains of large warriors clad who each wore an iron bangle. "We think they were warriors from a battle," she says. The unusual find suggests trade between Rome and Aksum started at least 200 years earlier than previously believed. As the dig is less than a month old, there's still a lot of information yet to come in about this restful lady. A bone expert wasn't able to ascertain her age at the time of death because the pelvis -- which usually provides a close approximation -- had been consumed by termites. Schofield hopes that analysis of the teeth will provide some answers. "There was something very personal about the way she was lying," Schofield says. The remains were also found surrounded by clay containers that likely contained food or drink (these have also been sent off for analysis). "The food, drink and cosmetics were all presumably left for her to use in the afterlife. She was pre-Christian and that's how people buried their dead then," says Schofield. Shofield has a bit of the Midas touch when it comes to extraordinary finds. She also recently uncovered a Roman-era perfume flask in the same cemetery, although by chance. The archaeologist is also the director of London-based NGO The Tigray Trust, and the item was first brought to her attention by a local farmer she knew through the organization. "I had been showing around a member of the Peace Corps who had been working in a nearby town (around the site), and we'd been out in the blazing sun for 8 hours, when a farmer I knew said his friend found something old, and he'd been keeping it for me," she recalls. "I was apologizing to the Peace Corps guy. I told him, 'it could be an old coffee pot, but you never know, it could be the Queen of Sheba's perfume flask.'"

            <descricao>Meet Lourens "Loux" Gebhardt -- a viral sensation from Namibia using social media to teach men how to dress.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Africa has started to gain a reputation as a continent of style. Take Congo's sartorially-elegant sapeurs or the "Afro-dandies" of Uganda. Now, the continent has a style kingpin in the form of Lourens "Loux" Gebhardt. Internal auditor by day and superstar stylist and tailor by night, this Namibian fashion guru is single-handedly reimagining what it means to dress like a gentleman. "I was born loving fashion. I believe in clothes that sit on your body properly," he muses. "I want to die when I see a person wearing an overdressed blazer!" His meticulously-crafted looks are carefully documented on his Tumblr blog and Instagram account. A multifarious collection of ensemble choices litter the social media networks. From his trademark three-piece suits to the dashing car selfies, the fastidious 34-year-old oozes confidence with a gentle touch of suave sophistication. He grins: "Everybody wants to look like me 'cause I look like a million bucks every day." Not that the ever-popular trendsetter is spending anywhere near that. In fact the amount he does spend might surprise you ‚Äî because he limits his monthly budget to $100. After being called out by his friends for wearing costly designer threads, Gebhardt was reintroduced to a world long forgotten: Vintage fashion. The sharp, tailored cuts evoked memories of his well-dressed grandfather. It's a look he pays tribute to, with aplomb. Today the in-demand blogger is now more widely known as "Loux the Vintage Guru" and lives by the mantra "dress cheap, look rich." "Once we buy these clothes, we try and modernize them to have a touch and look of what is currently trending," reveals the viral vintage star. "It's amazing how people love me," he opines. "I'll go into a shopping mall (and) people will be like, 'Look -- it's the vintage dude from Instagram." But while Gebhardt continues to blaze a trail for men's fashion across the continent, he never forgets his social media roots. "People will get hold of me from my Tumblr, Instagram and Facebook page. If people are unaware of how to put a suit on or how to put on a pocket square, they just go into my Tumblr, ask questions and I respond." Want to get more style tips from the debonair designer?

            <cabecalho>Is this the beginning of the end of child marriage? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Africa's leaders are starting to address the issue of 'child brides,' but is it enough?</descricao>
            <corpo>Lakshmi Sundaram is the executive director at Girls Not Brides. (CNN)Today marks the Day of the African Child. This day was created by the African Union to commemorate a tragedy -- the massacre of hundreds of children in Soweto, South Africa who were demonstrating for the basic right to a decent education. Since then, the day has been used as an opportunity to focus a global spotlight on the injustices African children face, and on the actions we all need to take to ensure they can realize their rights. This year, the theme for the day is ending child marriage in Africa, and it represents a timely call to end a practice that devastates the lives of millions of girls across the continent. We have seen promising positive commitments from the African Union and African leaders on the issue. We have also seen civil society mobilizing across the continent especially in reaching out to the communities where child marriage is prevalent. Many use the Girls Not Brides global network to amplify their voices and share lessons of what works in curbing this practice. This is crucial work since in sub-Saharan Africa, 40% of women are married as children, according to UNICEF. These girls are married off before they are physically or emotionally mature enough to become wives or mothers. Child marriage is an issue which affects girls in almost every country on the continent to a greater or lesser extent -- ten of the fifteen countries worldwide with the highest rates of child marriage are in Africa. In Niger, for example, as many as 76% of girls are married before they reach the age of 18; in Chad and the Central African Republic, it is 68%. Child marriage robs girls of their education, their health and their future. Over 60% of child brides in Africa have received no formal education whatsoever, and girls who give birth under the age of 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women who have children in their early 20s. Without major progress on this issue, the number of child brides will double by 2050 and child marriage will continue to hamper Africa's development. In fact, the persistence of child marriage has hindered Africa's efforts to achieve six of the eight Millennium Development Goals. That's why it is so crucial that we tackle child marriage head on in the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This week, the African Union is hosting a summit at which we hope African Heads of State will adopt a common African position on child marriage. Along with the SDGs, this represents a significant opportunity to ensure that commitments are quickly turned into practical national strategies and action plans that are comprehensive, well-resourced and involve all relevant actors including civil society so that the next generation of African girls can embrace a brighter, better future free from the shadow of child marriage.

            <cabecalho>Congo: painting colonial brutality in the DRC  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Congo's turbulent history is documented in a new art exhibition.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In front of a white building, with a Belgian flag flying high in the yard, a black man in a striped t-shirt and shorts is being strangled with a chain. Nearby, another black man is lying face down on the ground, his trousers pulled down to reveal deep bleeding cuts in his buttocks. Above him stands another black man, smartly dressed in a colonial police officer's uniform, whip raised above his head, ready to strike. The guard looks furtively over at a white man, in a white uniform with the Belgian flag sewn into his lapel, and a white pith helmet on his head. He smokes a pipe and has one hand in his pocket. His other hand casually directs the violence in the yard. This scene is from one of the paintings in a new exhibition, 53 Echoes of Zaire, which opens on 27 May at the Sulger-Buel-Lovell gallery in London. The painting, titled "Congo Belge II," was made in the 1970s and depicts a period in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (previously know as Zaire), a former Belgian colony. The Kingdom of Kongo rose in the 1300s, and part of it became Congo Free State, the private holding of Belgian King Leopold II, in the 1880s. Speaking of that colonial history, Christian Sulger-Buel, who co-founded the gallery says: "Belgian Congo is an extraordinary exception to the colonial norm. It was dramatically exploited by one man, King Leopold (II), who treated the people and the land like his private property. He owned Congo the way you'd own your car."  The artist, T. Kalema, was part of a group that came to be known as the "Lubumbashi Movement," artists living and working in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi. The work of the Lubumbashi Movement served as a way to document Congo's turbulent history. The political nature of the art created in Lubumbashi in the 1970s is particular to the city, which is the copper mining heartland of Congo. "In Kinshasa (the capital of the DRC) the subjects of art were typically social, lighter and with a lot of humor," says Salimata Diop, head of programs at London's Africa Centre, and the exhibition's curator. By contrast, artists who were part of the Lubumbashi Movement painted scenes from the slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, through to the brutality by the colonial masters and right up to their contemporary struggles: miners strikes, independence, the secession of Katanga, and hope in Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba that turns to despair as he's arrested and later killed. "These artists were not making 'airport art' -- art for foreigners or tourists to buy," says Diop. "They saw themselves as artisans and were making art for local people." Among these visual historians in Lubumbashi a sub-genre called "Colonie Belge" became popular. "These paintings typically depict a white man -- the colonial master -- impeccably dressed, doing nothing except watching a black man flog another black man, often while his family look on," explains Sulger-Buel. The images are striking not just for their graphic content but also for their use of color, a remarkable achievement considering the poverty in which the artists lived. "They had access to only basic primary colors and despite the fine lines in some of the paintings, only worked with large brushes," says Sulger-Buel.  Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu, the lead artist in the exhibition with over 30 works, had aspirations to be a teacher but became an artist. He was already prolific when he met Etienne Bol, a Belgian man his age with whom he struck up a friendship. Between 1971 and 73, Bol commissioned Kanda-Matulu and four other artists to paint the images displayed in the exhibition. Diop says: "Paintings (usually created on canvasses made from flour sacks) sold for very modest sums. Kanda-Matulu lived in a small one bedroom house and found it difficult to make a living from his art. He was very poor." Despite his contribution to popular Congolese art, Kanda-Matulu's life is shrouded in mystery. He met Etienne Bol in 1972, 10 years later, in 1982, he disappeared. People he knew thought he had gone back to his village, others speculated that he may have moved to neighboring Zambia. Given the political nature of his art, could his disappearance have been politically motivated? Diop doesn't think so but says: "Tshibumba was easy to find -- he was always working from home. But suddenly, he wasn't there anymore. In the troubled times (under the autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko) it was not uncommon for people to move a lot in search of a peaceful life. We don't know if he's alive or dead." The exhibition, which closes on June 30, the day Congo gained independence from Belgium 55 years ago, is overall a portrayal of what Sulger-Buel calls "the demons of Africa -- forced labor, civil war, violent repression of student protests," which still haunt Congo today. Whether seen as a retelling of the past or a perspective on its present day, the art and artists of the Lubumbashi Movement deserve a place in Congo's national history and on the global art scene.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A stowaway on a British Airways jet was found dead after falling on a roof as the plane approached London Heathrow Airport, authorities said Friday. It's unclear whether the man had crouched in the wheel well, a common hiding place for stowaways. A second man who was hiding in the undercarriage of the plane was hospitalized with injuries, the airline said. The plane was flying from Johannesburg to London when the man fell and landed above a business in Richmond, southwest London. Johannesburg and London are about 6,000 miles apart, and the flight is nearly 12 hours long. Airline tracking website FlightAware.com lists British Airways Flight 54 as a Boeing 747. It departed Johannesburg on Thursday night and arrived at Heathrow at 7:26 a.m. London time Friday. In a statement, the UK Metropolitan Police said an investigation is underway, and British Airways said it's working with authorities in both nations to get more details. Plenty of people have hitched a ride on a plane by holing up in a wheel well. Most don't survive. In April last year, a 15-year-old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a Boeing 767 and flew from San Jose, California, to Maui, Hawaii. He survived. In February of the same year, crews at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington found the body of a man inside the wheel well of a South African Airways plane. It's not difficult to climb inside a wheel well, said Jose Guillen, a ground operations coordinator at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. "You can grab onto the struts and landing gear assembly kind of like a ladder," he said. "And you just jump on the tire and climb into the wheel well." But after takeoff, many scenarios could kill a stowaway hiding in the landing gear wheel well. Inside, there's not much room -- even less than in the trunk of a car, Guillen said. A stowaway would need to guess where the tire is going to fold in when it closes after takeoff, he said. Otherwise, there's a high risk of getting crushed once the gear starts going in. This issue of stowaways making it aboard flights has raised questions about airport security. CNN's Richard Greene and Thom Patterson contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>Police thwarted an attack at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday, killing two of three armed assailants, the country's Interior Ministry said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Two assailants were killed and one injured in a thwarted attack at Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday morning, authorities said. The attackers confronted security officials at Karnak with firearms and explosives, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement. The three men, who were in a car, tried to enter the temple's parking lot when a plainclothes policeman forced it to stop, Egypt's Tourism Ministry said. Security forces confronted them, and two were killed: one died when he detonated the explosives he was carrying, and another was shot in the head, the Interior Ministry added. The third militant was injured. Egypt's Health Ministry said in a statement that five people were injured, including civilians. "The policeman who stopped the vehicle sustained minor injuries, but due to his heroic actions, many other potential victims were saved and thankfully no tourists were harmed," Tourism Minister Khaled Rami said. Typically, thousands of tourists visit Luxor and Karnak Temple daily. After the attack, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered an intensified security presence at vital sites in the country, including sites of antiquity, el-Sisi's office told CNN. Egypt's minister of antiquity and minister of tourism were in Luxor on Wednesday to assess the situation. This is the first deadly attack on a Luxor tourist site since 1997, when gunmen killed 62 people -- most of them international tourists.  The recent targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by Islamist militants in Egypt. Last week, gunmen shot and killed two police officers in an attack a few hundred meters from the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Interior Ministry said. Previously, militants, including the ISIS-aligned Ansar Beit Al Maqdis, mostly targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces. But four people were killed and 14 wounded when Ansar Beit Al Maqdis targeted a bus of South Korean tourists traveling from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into Israel in February 2014. Militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013. Recently, they expanded their targets to include judges. Wednesday's attack coincided with the signing of the African Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Several African leaders, including el-Sisi, are attending the summit in the Sinai Peninsula, hundreds of kilometers away from the site of Wednesday's attack. In a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to "resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime" and asserted the "legitimate right to self-defense." Security forces have arrested anyone belonging to or accused of working with the Brotherhood, a group designated by Egypt as a terrorist organization. Hundreds of Islamists and their supporters have been killed in the crackdown.  The Egyptian government has been trying to lure back tourists for the summer high season. Tourism represents 11.3% of Egypt's gross domestic product and 19.3% of its foreign currency revenues, Egypt's State Information Services says. "The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country," said Rami, the tourism minister. "We have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites, and we continue to take every possible measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)U.S. planes carried out a strike inside Libya on Sunday, reportedly killing a key terror figure in North Africa, U.S. and Libyan officials said. The target was Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a veteran Islamist fighter, who is blind in one eye, affiliated with al Qaeda in North Africa, a U.S. official told CNN. The Libyan government said Belmokhtar was killed in the strike, something that U.S. officials have not confirmed. Federal prosecutors in New York had charged Belmokhtar in 2013 with crimes related to a brazen attack on a gas facility in Algeria were 37 hostages died. Three Americans were among the dead. Two F-15 fighter jets dropped multiple 500-pound bombs on a hardened structure in the center of a compound, multiple U.S. defense officials told CNN. U.S. aerial intelligence assets were tracking Belmokhtar's movements at the time of the raid, a Pentagon official with direct knowledge of the operation told CNN, but the outcome of the operation was still being assessed. The initial indication was that Belmokhtar had been killed, the U.S. officials said, but they still lacked an absolute confirmation. The Libyan government went further in a statement Sunday, saying that the U.S. airstrike "led to the killing of Moktar Belmokhtar and a group of Libyans who are members of a terrorist organization in Eastern Libya." The strike happened at 2 a.m. Sunday (8 p.m. ET Saturday). In New York, Belmokhtar was charged on various conspiracy counts including hostage-taking, kidnapping, providing material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.  Belmokhtar is the founder of the Signed-in-Blood Battalion, also known as the al-Mulathamun Battalion. The group claimed responsibility for the January 2013 attack in Algeria. In the Algerian siege, heavily armed militants in pickups struck a sprawling state-owned natural gas complex near In Amenas, gathered the Westerners who worked there into a group and tied them up. Belmokhtar had said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. The Algerian military tried to negotiate with the militants during the standoff, but their demands to release militants held prisoner in Algeria were deemed unreasonable, leading to intervention by special forces troops. The gas facility operated in cooperation with foreign energy firms such as Norway's Statoil and Britain's BP -- and as such, employed workers from several Western countries.

            <descricao> If you thought vegetable oil was only for cooking, think again. In Lusaka, Zambia, one entrepreneur is converting used oil into fuel.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The light bulb -- a simple glass shell with a glowing filament that lights our homes, businesses and cities, once night descends. A simple convenience most of us take for granted. But when the sun sets in Africa and darkness falls, many are forced to live through an overnight blackout until the next day dawns. A staggeringly low 24% of the sub-Saharan population have access to electricity with some 25 nations suffering rolling blackouts due to the ongoing energy crisis on the continent, according to the World Bank. More recently, Makhtar Diop, the global financial institution's vice president for Africa, called on his African compatriots to do more to solve the continent's energy struggles. "All emerging countries have to solve the energy crisis. We have to be on par with other nations, ensuring we produce enough energy for Africa at affordable rates," said Diop at the International Conference on the Emergence of Africa in Abidjan, C√¥te d'Ivoire. Moreover, the recent crippling fuel crisis in Nigeria was a stark reminder of our dependance on oil. But while leaders and global organizations continue to work toward implementing a sustainable infrastructure to ease the crisis, entrepreneurs are also taking it upon themselves to provide solutions for alternative energy. In Zambia's capital Lusaka, Mutoba Ngoma saw a need for action -- and with his extensive background in aeronautical engineering, the shrewd businessman decided to do something about it. He says: "I had just completed my schooling in the UK in aeronautical engineering and I came across a program about renewable energy in Brazil. At the same time Zambia was going through fuel shortages." He founded Tapera -- a biofuel company that converts used vegetable oil into fuel -- in 2006 with a two-fold mission in mind: increase the country's fuel supply sustainability and provide vocational training and stable job opportunities. At first it was very much a backyard business -- with around 200 liters a month cleaned and processed. Today that figure has ballooned to 3,000 liters each month and generates about $15,000. The astute technologist has also started designing his own oil processing machines, in turn, steadily building his client base. "We've got one major client that takes the bulk of what we produce and then we've got about seven or eight small clients that come in for small quantities." Even though Ngoma had established a fairly stable business -- they still faced challenges of finding enough used vegetable oil for their bio-diesel. So the discerning businessman decided to diversify their product range -- with soap. "The idea of making soaps came about as a result of one of our challenges of securing enough raw material for the diesel. We realized as we were waiting for more oil to come about we could actually be producing something else. And we found that we could actually produce soap from the same oil. "So we just had to clean it a bit more and it's even cheaper to process than the diesel. We stuck with it because we felt it is also a good income generator." Watch the video below to learn more about how Ngoma is growing his bio-fuel business. Read more: How did Nigeria nearly run out of gas? More from African Startup  </corpo>

            <descricao>Chad conducted airstrikes against Boko Haram sites in Nigeria and announced it has banned burqas after twin bombings by veiled attackers.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The central African country of Chad conducted airstrikes against Boko Haram sites in neighboring Nigeria on Wednesday and announced it has banned burqas, the head-to-toe garment worn by some Muslim women, after twin bombings earlier this week by veiled attackers. The Chad army and security forces hit Boko Haram bases and related sites, according to a government statement, destroying six bases and killing several militants. Prime Minister Kalzeube Payimi Deubet announced the burqa ban Wednesday following a call with religious leaders, according to another statement from the government. The move was at the direction of President Idriss Deby Itno, after as many as 23 people were killed Monday in the capital, N'Djamena, in two attacks -- one at the National School of Police and the other targeting the Central Office of the Police, according to Chad's communications ministry. The four attackers were also killed, and more than 100 people were wounded, officials said.  The government blamed the terror group Boko Haram for the bombings, but the militants have not claimed responsibility. Some have speculated that the attacks Monday were retaliation for Chad's participation in a regional force fighting against Boko Haram. The group struck outside Nigeria again Wednesday, raiding two villages in Niger and killing at least 38 people, a local lawmaker said.  According to the Chadian news website Tchadinfos, security forces have been ordered to go through markets and burn all the burqas they find. Chad is a majority Muslim country, but some may wear the burqa as protection from the sun and sand. According to the government statement, Catholic church leaders, Muslim leaders and evangelical leaders were briefed on the ban and were asked to convey the new law to their respective congregations. Boko Haram, which loosely translates to "Western education is sin" in the Hausa language, is classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. It has been brutal against civilians and authorities alike as it tries to impose its extreme version of Sharia law over an expansive territory. Residents of Borno state, which borders Chad, and other parts of northeastern Nigeria know this all too well. For years they have dealt with Boko Haram assaults, bombings, abductions and mass kidnappings -- the most infamous being the taking of more than 200 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok in 2014. Chad and Niger have stepped up their efforts in recent months, going after the militant group in areas that border those nations. CNN's Christian Purefoy, Joseph Netto, Greg Botelho and Elwyn Lopez, as well as journalist Aminu Abubakar, contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>On the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. Shereen El Feki says that needs to change.</descricao>
            <corpo>Shereen El Feki is the author of "Sex and the Citadel: Intimate Life in a Changing Arab World," a study of changing sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Got a question for Shereen? Let us know in the comments -- we'll answer some of the best ones Thursday on Connect the World at 11:00 a.m. ET. Cairo, Egypt (CNN)In a packed Cairo theater a couple of months ago, Ali Qandil brought down the house. "Why do Egyptian fathers cry at their daughters' weddings?" the comedian asked the crowd. "Because they know their little girls will be having sex for the first time." In Egypt's current conservative climate, Qandil's well-aimed thrust at sexual taboos was enough to send the audience into stitches, even as the theater management reached for its smelling salts. The show was courtesy of Al-Hubb Thaqafa ("Love is Culture"), a groundbreaking social media platform offering straight talk on love, sex and relationships in Arabic. Launched just over a year ago, its website, YouTube channel and social feeds have attracted more than nine million visitors, mainly from Egypt and Morocco. Al-Hubb Thaqafa's no-nonsense approach to sex, offering accurate information on everything from the basic facts of life to the finer points of fellatio, is a welcome development in a region where teachers are often too embarrassed to communicate even the barebones sexual and reproductive curriculum on offer, and parents generally draw a veil of silence over such topics with their kids. For Ali Qandil, sex is an endless source of humor -- just as it is anywhere else in the world. But on the face of it, sex is no laughing matter across the Arab region. In recent weeks, accounts of the arrest and abuse of dozens of gay men and transsexual women in Egypt, or mass sexual exploitation under ISIS' reign of terror, or Morocco's recent ban on a new film which lays bare the country's thriving sex trade, do little to dispel the image of societies mired in sexual repression. But by emphasizing sex as a pleasure to be enjoyed, rather than a problem to be solved, Al-Hubb Thaqafa hearkens to a long tradition of free and frank exchange on sexual matters in Arabic. Short of cybersex and internet porn, there isn't much its platforms tackle that our forefathers from weren't writing about more than a millennium ago. READ MORE: 13 signs you're probably in Cairo There is nothing un-Islamic about talking about sex; indeed, many of the great works of Arabic erotica were written by religious scholars. But over the centuries, and in particular in recent decades with rise of Islamic fundamentalism, societies across the Arab region have become far less comfortable in their sexual skin. Al-Hubb Thaqafa offers a chance (in part by reclaiming Arabic as a language of sexuality and offering a "respectable" alternative to street slang) for men and women to talk each other about sex -- asking questions, sharing personal experiences and contesting each other's opinions without the usual embarrassment or censure. Such opportunities are all too rare offline. It's been two years since I published "Sex and the Citadel" -- a five-year investigation into sexual attitudes and behaviors across the Arab region, and their intersection with politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations. Since then, the grand political aspirations which fed the Arab Spring have either frosted over, as in Egypt, or burnt up in the conflagration now consuming Libya, Yemen and Syria. Sex might seem an odd focus these days, given all the other pressing issues in the region. But it is never far from politics, as authoritarian powers -- be they military-backed presidents or religious extremists -- know only too well, using matters of flesh, wrapped in selective interpretations of Islam, to clamp down on their communities. This is sadly true beyond the borders of the Middle East as well. But the converse also holds. Realizing the rallying cries of the recent uprisings -- "freedom", "justice" and "dignity" -- in private life will, in the long run, have profound implications for public life as well. When it comes to sex, it is never black and white, as conservatives would have us believe. In this, as with so many other aspects of life, there are at least 50 shades of gray. On my travels, I've met men and women across the Arab region who are exploring that spectrum. Doctors like Chafik Chraibi, a Moroccan obstetrician whose efforts to open up his country's restrictive abortion laws have helped to catalyze a recent small step in legal reform. Educators like Safa Tamish, a Palestinian living in Israel, who is working to get sex education into schools and families across the West Bank. Or activists like the founders of Chouf and Damj, two new Tunisian NGOS, which are among the dozens of groups across the region trying to find a place for men and women whose sexualities or gender identities break the mold. There are many, many more such initiatives -- combating sexual violence, or securing the rights of unwed mothers or providing sexual health services to unmarried youth, for example -- springing up across the Middle East, often on very rocky ground. The most successful work slowly, along the grain of religion and culture. Confrontation -- be it political protests in Tahrir Square or Femen-style baring of breasts -- is not the way to achieve tangible, durable change in the Arab region, as recent events have clearly demonstrated. For too many -- particularly women -- sex is still bound up in shame, which makes it a powerful tool of political and social control. Sexual freedoms are hard to exercise when family interests trump individual choice, or when appearance counts for more than reality -- when virginity is defined by a piece of anatomy -- an intact hymen -- rather than a state of chastity, or when prostitution masquerades as marriage between wealthy visitors and desperate refugees. Shifting the political, economic and social conditions which underpin these realities is the work of a generation at least. But at least in a few places, positive change is slowly taking root. As my Egyptian grandmother used to say, "If there were seeds for patience, I would have planted fields." In other words, what we need is a sexual evolution, not revolution.

            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)A court in Egypt upheld a death sentence Tuesday against former President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, 63, was sentenced to death last month for his role in a 2011 prison break. Morsy, along with 16 other Muslim Brotherhood leaders, was also given a life sentence for espionage. Life in Egypt means 25 years. Three more senior members of the organization -- Khairat Al Shater, Mohamed Beltagy and Ahmed Abdel Alaty -- were sentenced to death by hanging. The political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Freedom and Justice Party, called the decision "politicized" and the charges "fabricated." "President Morsy's trial has fallen far below the most basic international legal standards," a statement from the Muslim Brotherhood said. "Today's announcement is another nail in the coffin for democracy in Egypt." It called on the international community to stop what it called the "cruel dictatorship" of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The military ousted Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader, in 2013.

            <cabecalho>Sudan's Omar al-Bashir leaves South Africa - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir left South Africa, government confirms, as court considered whether to arrest him on war crimes charges. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, a man accused of war crimes and genocide, has left South Africa one step ahead of the law. Al-Bashir left the country Monday just as a South African High Court decided to order his arrest. The human rights group that had petitioned the court to order al-Bashir's arrest, the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, said in a statement it was disappointed that the government allowed the Sudanese President to leave before the ruling. Judge Hans Fabricius had ruled Sunday that al-Bashir had to stay in South Africa while a court considered whether he should be arrested. The judge also ordered all ports in the country to prevent the Sudanese leader from leaving. But lawyers arguing in court for al-Bashir's arrest warned, in advance, that the ports of entry and exit were not obeying the judge's order. "Being an organisation committed to the rule of law, SALC is encouraged by the Court's order and the independence of the judicial process," said Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, the group's director. "The rule of law, however, is only as strong as the government which enforces it. Home Affairs have allowed a fugitive from justice to slip through its fingers, compounding the suffering of the victims of these grave crimes." Al-Bashir's departure was confirmed by the South African and Sudanese governments. Sudan's state news agency, SUNA, reported that Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour would hold a news conference at the airport Monday evening "following return of the President of the Republic." It is unclear in light of the judge's order what help al-Bashir might have received, and from whom. His plane had been relocated earlier from Tambo International Airport, near Johannesburg, to Waterkloof military base, south of Pretoria. And sometime after that, the alleged war criminal went to the military base and slipped through the net.  His departure came as the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria was considering a request by the International Criminal Court to arrest him on charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The ICC charges against al-Bashir stem from the conflict in the Darfur region in western Sudan, which began in 2003. The government of Sudan has been accused of repression and ethnic cleansing of Darfur's non-Arab population. Al-Bashir had been in South Africa attending a two-day summit of African Union leaders. Fabricius, the judge, said Sunday that he wanted to determine whether it was legally acceptable for Pretoria to allow al-Bashir to visit South Africa without arresting him -- and key in that decision would be determining if the South African Cabinet's decision not to comply with the ICC demand could trump an international treaty, South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper reported.  Earlier Monday, when al-Bashir's whereabouts were still unclear, the chairman of South Africa's Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation, Siphosezwe Masango, said he was concerned about the Sudanese President's possible arrest. "This is an opportunistic act only meant to pit African leaders against each other in the name of international law," Masango said in a statement. He urged the leaders gathered for the summit to concentrate instead on regional trade, xenophobia and the development of Africa's infrastructure. He said the ICC appeared to target African leaders and, if the trend continued, his committee might have to recommend that the government re-examine South Africa's membership in the international court. But the U.N.'s high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, warned that member states had to follow ICC rules. "It is of deep concern to me and my office when court orders are issued by the ICC in respect of the serving head of state of Sudan, and state parties to the Rome Statute openly flout them," he said Monday at a meeting of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. The Rome Statute was a treaty that established the International Criminal Court. "In this regard, we await the ruling of the Pretoria High Court this morning, as it assesses the request submitted by the ICC," he said. Sidiki Kaba, the Senegalese justice minister who serves as president of the assembly of states parties to the Rome Statute, expressed his "deep concern about the negative consequences for the court in case of nonexecution of the warrants by States Parties and, in this regard, urges them to respect their obligations to cooperate with the Court." South Africa, Kaba said in a statement, should "spare no effort" to arrest al-Bashir. South Africa had twice before threatened to arrest al-Bashir -- in 2009 before President Jacob Zuma's inauguration and in 2010 before the World Cup, according to the Southern Africa Litigation Centre. He attended neither event, according to news reports.  Arrest warrants from 2009 and 2010 outline the case against al-Bashir and allege that during the Darfur conflict he ordered the military, police and Janjaweed militia to attack three ethnic groups deemed sympathetic to rebel outfits with "the specific intent to destroy in part" those groups. As part of that campaign, the warrants say, the Sudanese President ordered the rape, murder and torture of civilians and the razing of villages. The United Nations has estimated that as many as 300,000 people have been killed in the Darfur conflict since 2003, a tally the Sudanese government says is inflated. Another 7 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates. Putting a face on refugee crisis Last week, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations told the Security Council that the ongoing violence in Darfur was having a "devastating" impact on civilians. More than 78,000 civilians have been displaced this year, the U.N. reports. CNN's Brent Swails and Tony Wende contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>'Young Africa is facing a housing crisis' - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>As Africa's urbanization and population boom leads to an economic "demographic dividend" it is also causing a housing crisis for youth across the continent.</descricao>
            <corpo>James Mugerwa is managing director of Shelter Afrique, a Pan-African Housing Institution. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author alone. (CNN)Young Africa has a problem. Well, to be sure young Africa will face many challenges in the near future but curiously one of them seems to be under the radar -- not a priority item for governments and institutions. To hear the experts tell it, Africa will experience a population boom in the coming years and should be reaping what many economists have termed a demographic dividend. What will be happening on the other side of this is rapid urbanization? UN-Habitat estimates that by 2030, all developing regions, specifically sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, will have more people living in urban than rural areas. It denotes for many the progress that is being made by African economies; certainly urbanization in isolation can be seen as an indication of development and growth. The theory is that if we have people trooping to and staying in our urban centers then it must be that we have created the jobs to attract and sustain them.  Let's return to another interesting statistic that was mentioned above: Africa will experience a population boom in almost of all its major economies. Nigeria is expected to have 174 million people between the age of 15-64 by 2035; in the Democratic Republic of Congo that number is predicted to be 70 million, in Kenya that number is 45 million and in South Africa that number is 40 million. Everywhere on the continent is expected to swell in numbers in the next two decades according to a UN-Habitat State of the World Cities Report.  Another set of interesting numbers to look at is the current housing deficit in most of the major economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria the housing deficit is estimated to be 17 million units annually. In nearby Ghana an estimated 170,000 housing units are required every year over the next 10 years. The recently concluded 2013 Housing Survey by the Ministry of Lands and Housing in Kenya doesn't fare any better with the deficit estimated at 2 million houses over the next 10 years.   All these statistics and numbers have a very real and clear implication for housing and they paint a very simple picture: on the one hand you have a young and vibrant workforce coming into its own against the backdrop of too few houses, on the other hand you have droves of new city dwellers who cannot afford or find decent affordable housing, creating new slums. The population boom, rapid urbanization and housing deficits across the continent is a three-dimensional problem with the same end: crisis. There is precious little that can be done about the rapid urbanization. There is a high entertainment culture attracting young people from the rural areas. It is easy to spot them on the streets of Lagos, Nairobi, Dakar, Johannesburg, Luanda, and Kinshasa. Many have bought into the new African dream and they will keep coming and we should encourage it. But only for a moment, because the realities of daily African life are all too apparent; we are always only moments away from the next clash of communities or outbreak of widespread violence. To the casual observer it seems immediate, spontaneous without reason, but that is not the case. These crises are often fueled by the intangibles: unemployment, inadequate access to decent housing, inadequate access to basic social services and the frustration that stems from all this. The failing of the new African dream for so many. None of this analysis is particularly ground-breaking or new -- however, it is interesting how little attention affordable housing receives as a factor to quality of life and as a possible deterrent to chaos and social disorder. Naturally, governments with limited resources and tenure and an increasingly more informed and more involved electorate shy away from long-term capital intensive projects; they want quick wins and sellable achievements.  These questions frame the impending housing crisis, but how should they be answered? What can be done? A myriad of things, but we must first begin with the notion that no one organization or government can solve the housing problem by itself; it will require a coming together of shared interests. We must also determine that a one-dimensional approach will not suffice. We can then move on to tackling sociocultural impressions of home ownership and brick and mortar homes. The housing conversation in Africa has always begun and ended with home ownership, while the fact remains that most Africans cannot afford to buy a home at current market rates. Rental housing is a legitimate option and is a reality for most Africans. It is time to have it supported with government incentives and legislation. It is an option that has yielded results in countries like Germany and the Netherlands, clearly documented in a 2014 World Bank Report. We must also combat the preference for houses built with traditional methods; alternative building technologies continue to push the boundaries and introduce efficient and effective ways of constructing at reduced cost. Materials like mud and plastic have been deployed to wonderful effect and can significantly cut the cost for constructing a unit, but we still persist with the traditional ways of home construction even when we cannot afford it. We must also find ways to control the value chain a lot more; housing in Africa is expensive primarily because most of the material is sourced and imported. It will be interesting to see if a boom in manufacturing doesn't drastically reduce the cost of building materials. It is always funny how often people miss the relation between transportation and housing. If African transport systems are upgraded to include rail especially, it would give a city a rebirth and allow it to expand and create various suburbs or sleeper cities that would be less expensive to live in than the city centers. The housing conversation is a continuous one and it is one that will see a lot of changes as we witness symmetrical changes in technology, demographics and urbanization. However, it must always begin with the notion that we are running out of time to solve the housing problem and there is a new generation of Africans expecting to be housed. There are a thousand ways to approach the problem: not doing anything isn't one of them. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Mugerwa. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Five things Buhari must tackle now that he's president - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>As Nigeria's new president takes over, one of those who worked to get him elected explains what he needs to do to restore the country's prospects.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Chude Jideonwo is managing partner of Red Media Africa, which runs Africa's largest portfolio of youth media brands. One of the brands, StateCraft Inc was official communication agency to the Buhari Presidential Campaign and spent the past six months working to get him elected. Below he details the five things that the president must do now that he's in power. The opinions expressed are solely those of Chude Jideonwo's. (CNN)Disclosure is important: I have been part of a team that worked for the new Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari -- from building the cache of photos that defined his image to getting fliers across the country in all of our languages. I have gone from grudgingly voting for him in 2011 (I made up my mind an hour before voting) to enthusiastically putting relationships and business on the line for what seemed like a quixotic quest. But long after Muhammadu Buhari is President of Nigeria's Federal Republic, I will still be a citizen. And as a citizen, I know, that by this evening, the honeymoon will be over. He knows this more than anyone else, and he certainly doesn't need advice to do what he does best -- work hard, and fast. Still, these would be my suggestions for his top five priorities. Set an example: The cult of personality that led President Buhari to victory was built on a simple premise -- Nigeria, for once, needs a man shorn of greed; who owns less in terms of material, and covets even less. There are those who insist that the fate of a nation cannot lie solely on Buhari's personality, and perhaps they are right. But the 'lau lau' (Nigerian slang for wasteful) lifestyle of the president who is leaving office led to unprecedented waste, and turned corruption into art. Now, because of Buhari's reputation, governments and corporate Nigeria have begun to tighten their belts. Oil marketers are suspended in terror; people even expect the cost of land in Nigeria to drop. If he steps into power, and changes; then nothing he says and nothing he does will matter. It will ruin everything. And what a darn shame that will be. Subsidy has to go There has long been a media and elite consensus that Nigeria's labyrinth of petro-politics -- which swallows at least $4.2 billion yearly in the name of subsidy -- is a scam. Unfortunately, because he lacked both the credibility and the vision to overhaul that system, Nigerians rightly railed against President Goodluck Jonathan when he tried to remove the subsidy in 2012. The argument was simple -- why force us to tighten our belts when you continue to buy new presidential jets? Thankfully, President Buhari has the competence (as former oil minister) and the personal credibility to make that decision now. It will be a bloody billion-dollar fight. But he, frankly, has no choice. #BringBackOurGirls The President-Elect has said he cannot know if the 219 Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko Haram last year will be found, and he is right. Still, Boko Haram has ravaged this country in many ways, but above all it has stolen our faith in government. The girls stand as a symbol of our hopelessness -- that despite a world unified in horror and haste, our government has yet failed. To re-inspire a nation to reconnect with its strength and its will, there is no stronger message than for those girls to be found. Cost of government The cost of running Nigeria is obscene. The federal wage bill, at $9 billion, currently outstrips the expected revenue from crude oil sales and Nigeria's current budget deficit stands at $5 billion, despite more than three years of crude oil prices averaging over $100 a barrel. The salary for 469 federal legislators stands at $750 million. It sounds like a cliche, but it is no less true -- simply cutting the obscene amounts we spend on 'public service' will help Nigeria with more money for the things that truly matter -- regenerating industry, creating jobs, unloading the power sector, social security, saving. Entrepreneurs matter I am an entrepreneur, and I know that it's incredibly hard to be one in this country. There is no access to finance, there's multiple-taxation and a crippling patronage system that relies on endorsements and kickbacks. We lack systems that enable us to truly unlock wealth and sustain growth for entrepreneurs. Nigeria is lucky to have a proven entrepreneurial energy proven in new-industry addition (over $552 billion) to our GDP, and a massive influx of foreign direct investment. It is time for our government to actually connect with the aspiration of an eager youth population that's fired up and ready to go. As we say in Nigeria, time is going.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Boko Haram militants killed at least 38 people in raids on two villages in Niger's Diffa region, ‚Äéclose to the border with Nigeria, a local lawmaker said Thursday. Scores of Boko Haram gunmen struck the Ungumawo and Lamina villages Wednesday, killing residents and burning substantial parts of the communities, according to lawmaker Bulu Mammadou, who visited the area. Mammadou said the victims were mostly women and children. "The attackers opened fire on the villages and set homes ablaze, burning women and children alive in their homes," he said. The attack on Lamina was the deadliest, with 28 residents killed -- 24 of them women and children, the lawmaker said. "I lost my entire family of seven including my wife, mother and five children who were burned alive inside my house‚Äé by the attackers," Lamina resident Malam Abba said. This was the second attack this week by Nigeria-based Boko Haram in another country. Monday, four attackers launched assaults on two police facilities in the Chadian capital N'Djamena, killing at least 23. Chad responded Wednesday with airstrikes on multiple Boko Haram sites in Nigeria, the government said. The N'Djamena attacks are believed to be Boko Haram's response to the increasing role of Chad in the regional fight against the group, which the United States has named as a terrorist organization. Last week, the leaders of Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin ‚Äéagreed to set up the headquarters of the 8,700-strong multinational force to fight Boko Haram in N'Djamena. The force is scheduled to begin operations July 30. Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, Nigeria. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Koa Bosco: Italy's 'Miracle' team of African migrants - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The soccer players of Koa Bosco have become accustomed to racial taunts. But this team of African migrants playing in Italy has the best response: Winning.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The insults are crude, but they hit home hard. Shi**y African. Shi**y black people. The players of Koa Bosco have suffered many such racial taunts since their football club was formed in 2013. On occasion, physical violence has even flared on the pitch, says the Italian team's manager Domenico Mammoliti. "The ignorance of some people..." he sighs, revealing a hint of exasperation at the abuse he says his players have endured. Life in the Italian lower leagues is clearly tough. Yet it's nothing compared to the journey undertaken by this team of African immigrants and refugees from countries such as Ghana, Senegal, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Mali, the Ivory Coast, Togo and Sudan. Many risked their very existence crossing the Mediterranean Sea on rickety boats, often fleeing war, poverty and persecution in search of a better life in Europe. The U.N. Refugee Agency estimates that more than 3,500 people perished making the same journey in 2014. This year, 1,850 are believed to have died out of roughly 100,000 people who have attempted the crossing. And for most of those who do make it, life in Europe is hardly a paradise of milk and honey. Work away from the football pitch for most Koa Bosco players consists of picking fruit on farms for a paltry wage, Mammoliti said. And they are the ones lucky enough to find employment.  Koa Bosco midfielder Almani Camara, originally from Gambia, told CNN that he arrived in Italy after boarding a smugglers' boat in Libya. Camara said he risked the trip as he "doesn't hear any gunfire" or "see any dead people" in Europe as he did in Libya. His vessel was crammed full of people from all over Africa and had to be rescued after running into what he describes as "difficulties." The journey, he admits, could have easily have ended in tragedy -- yet still the migrants flock to Europe. CNN's Christiane Amanpour witnessed a packed boat intercepted by the Italian navy close to the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa only last month. One person had died after suffocating on the ramshackle wooden boat while three people had to be medevaced off. Such horrors all too familiar to the players of Koa Bosco. But the last few weeks have provided a welcome distraction from harder times and memories of struggles elsewhere. After just two years of existence, the team based in the southern town of Rosarno -- situated in the toe of Italy's geographical "boot" -- achieved promotion from the bottom tier of the country's football league pyramid. It was a triumph so unlikely that Mammoliti said he's still trying to convince himself it actually happened. "I had one of the greatest emotions of my life," he says. "It was a true miracle." For Camara, it was a victory forged in togetherness and teamwork against an adversity that went way beyond sporting competition. "They tried to fight some of our players," he said of the sides Koa Bosco faced over the course of the season. "(But) to win made us very happy." Koa Bosco will now play in the non-professional Segunda Categoria which comprises higher caliber teams from the wider Calabria region. The Segundo lies seven levels below Serie A, Italy's top division. Although there may still be a long way to go reach the likes of Juventus, AC Milan, Roma, Lazio and Internazionale, the success marks an incredible beginning for what is essentially a church team.  The club was founded by Mammoliti, his colleague Domenico Bagala and a priest named Don Roberto Meduri before entering the Italian Football Federation last year. Its aim was to bring attention to the plight of migrants arriving in Italy. Rosarno itself has experienced its fair share of racial tensions in recent years. In 2010, days of rioting followed the shooting of an African migrant. In the hours and days after, many migrants were evacuated from the area. CNN even reported that a van was touring Rosarno blaring out the message: "Any black person who is hiding in Rosarno should get out. If we catch you, we will kill you." Koa Bosco's achievement is all the more notable given this history, not to mention the legacy of troubles faced by the players in their home countries. "They (the players) don't know the language very well," Mammoliti says. "They don't have means of sustaining themselves or making enough money. "Many of them come (to Europe) for family reasons, because they were poor, because of wars in their own countries or because of some sort of struggle with the Islamic laws or the tribes that were in control of their territories." Support has come from a number of people in the local community who have followed the team home and away, often donating money and food. But Mammoliti explains that Rosarno's response to Koa Bosco hasn't always been positive. Although there are many who applaud what they have done, others "have reacted with ignorance." This continuing battle has led Mammoliti to step down as manager of Koa Bosco and help set up another new club that aims to field African migrants and local players together. Mammoliti sees many similarities between the people of Calabria and migrants from Africa. "Our kids have no work, no hope," he says. "They expatriate to find something more promising." Calabria is already one of the most depressed regions in Italy. Unemployment reached 23.4% in 2014, according to data collated by Eurostat, ensuring the influx of new arrivals from Africa has put further strain on the region's social fabric. Mammoliti hopes the new club, which he says will be called San Michel and has been founded alongside another local priest named Don Gaudioso, will help preach a message of tolerance and integration among the people of Rosarno and beyond.  "Together we can get to the goal of ... putting the local kids and the Africans together in a group," he says. "They (migrants) are paying the price of disinformation and ignorance because Italy is in the middle of severe crisis and we blame the black man." Mammoliti's words are indicative of the wider political debate regarding immigration currently raging across Europe. Some even suggest Europe has a historical debt given the often brutal colonial record of Britain, France, Germany and Italy in Africa. There's almost certainly more to this complex, multi-layered issue than that. Yet geographic location puts Rosarno, Calabria and Italy on the front line like few other places when it comes to dealing with the consequences. As such, showing tolerance and creating an example of understanding between communities which others can follow will continue to be the primary goal for the founders and management of Koa Bosco. Even more so than performing another miracle by rising up further through the Italian leagues. Do you have any inspiring football stories?

            <descricao>Remember these young entrepreneurs -- because what they are doing is going to transform Africa. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)What can you achieve by the age of thirty? A lot, it transpires. A new list compiled by Forbes Africa has set out to prove that age is no barrier to success, profiling thirty top entrepreneurs on the continent who have yet to reach that milestone. They range from tech startups to medical solutions; food production to the media. Despite their diverse backgrounds they all share one thing in common: the drive and vision to succeed in the booming African market. Alain Nteff, developer of the Gifted Mom app and recent winner of the Queen's Young Leaders Award heads the list alongside serial entrepreneur Ludwick Marishane and air ambulance pioneer Olamide Orekunrin all make an appearance in the roundup. Speaking on how young minds are transforming the continent, Nigeria-based Orekunrin, 29, says: "Africa desperately needs more entrepreneurs. "I think it's important that Forbes has decided to bring its global brand to the continent and that it's showcasing African entrepreneurship."  South African Bheki Kunene, 27, founder of Mind Trix Media, sought autonomy as the end goal of his entrepreneurship. Running a business, he says, allowed him to have "dominion over all aspects of [his] life." Similarly, internet supplier Rupert Bryant, 29,says "challenging the status quo" and a strict sense of independence was integral to his success. However Byrant, who dropped out of school at 14 to start his first web development company, says no entrepreneur makes it entirely on their own. He admits to having been "very lucky to always have exceptional people around me to inspire, guide and motivate me." But being a top businessmind means thinking outside of the box -- and beyond your own country's borders. Clinton Mutambo, 25, has set up a digital hub for intra-African trade. Called Esaja, the site allows suppliers and buyers from the continent to come together in a virtual borderless economy. Drawing on his upbringing in an economically turbulent Zimbabwe, he realized the businesses "that survived were ultimately those that had embraced seemingly less attractive African markets." Mutambo, therefore, sought to open up such markets. "The recognition by Forbes Africa," he says, "is a humbling experience."

            <descricao>Merging technological advancement and medicine has always gone hand-in-hand. Here are 5 startups shaking up healthcare in Africa. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in rural areas, accessing a health clinic isn't always as simple as it should be. Poor roads can mean a trip to the doctor could be a days-long journey. As a result, several start-ups have launched that bring medical advances directly into the home -- or smartphone. Despite the huge leaps being made in the medical field in Africa, there are still an estimated 3.2 million children living with HIV, with a majority in sub-Saharan Africa. And 90% of the world's malaria fatalities also come from the region. But it doesn't mean that Africa is a lost cause. Mobile technology is emerging as a powerful ally in medical innovation on the continent. As it continues to grow at an exponential rate, a vibrant mobile health -- or mHealth -- industry is blossoming. Startups are emerging with one purpose in mind: to create tech solutions for healthcare professionals. One such company is Access Mobile, founded in Uganda by social entrepreneur Kaak Yelpaala. After years of working in the public health sector -- Yelpaala began his training at Yale University before becoming one of the early employees of the Clinton Health Access Initiative in East Africa -- he was inspired to develop his own startup providing mobile tech solutions for the industry he had become so passionate about. "Access Mobile is a company that builds software solutions for healthcare providers to better improve the health of their patients through mobile phones," he says. "Having lived in countries like Tanzania, Kenya, here in Uganda and other parts of the region, what really compelled me was believing that no matter where you live in the world you should be able to access a certin level of care. And technology plays a role in that." Cue his first software platform -- an app called Clinic Communicator designed to facilitate an easier interaction between doctors and patients in the region. The web-based platform helps medical professionals communicate with the patients through emails and SMS. Doctors are able to send messages directly to their patients and in the process tackle issues like long waiting times, unnecessary queuing, missed appointments and prescription reminders. Yelpaala is not the only tech-savvy entrepreneur using mobile technology to reach patients and provide better healthcare. To crack down on counterfeit drugs and medicines in the marketplace, former astrophysicist Bright Simons went back to Ghana and created mPedigree, a simple idea where codes are printed on prescription packaging and customers can check its legitimacy by sending a text message. Meanwhile, Cameroonian IT specialist Arthur Zang designed "Africa's first handheld medical computer tablet" last year to provide medical professionals in more rural regions to get cardiac tests results to specialists in a speedier manner. It hasn't always been smooth sailing for Yelpaala. It's been four years since he began his business and he had to provide incentives to peak interest at first. "We have started to get our first customers which has been a great milestone for us. Our first approach was to offer the product on trials and say "use this product"." He adds: "What we're finding now is that we're already starting to get traction in Kenya. We're partnering with healthcare facilities there. The thought is that we have to think very big, we have to think Pan-African, and we have to think about how we can innovate for the world." More from African Startup  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Egypt: Dog mummies in catacombs estimated in millions - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>An estimated 8 million mummified animals, mostly dogs, were laid in the catacombs of Anubis, a high figure that surprises even veteran Egyptologists.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For centuries, dogs have been humans' loyal, domesticated companions. They've been wild animals, doing what's needed to survive. And in ancient Egypt, they served as bridges to the afterlife, with the hope that they'd intercede with the god Anubis on their owner's behalf. But only now is it becoming known the extent to which dogs served this latter role -- 8 million times over. That is the number of dead animals, most of them dogs, estimated to have laid in the catacombs of Anubis around Saqqara, one of Egypt's most historic and oft-visited sites, according to a group of British researchers. While such mass burials aren't unprecedented, given the numerous animal cults of ancient Egypt, this one's scale makes it unique. "We're very pleased and somewhat surprised by the results," the project's director Paul Nicholson from Cardiff University's School of History, Archaeology and Religion said Saturday. "We hadn't expected that there would be so many animals, and it opens up a new series of questions." One question that experts can at least partially answer is why an Egyptian might have brought an animal, dead or alive, to such a place. Nicholson, who has been studying animal cults since the 1990s, explains that people wouldn't have come simply to kill or even bury an animal so much as allow it to move onto a different plane. A dog, especially, would be a good fit because it might then interact with Anubis, an ancient Egyptian god of the dead depicted with the body of a man and head of a dog or, its close relative, a jackal. "The important thing was to provide a representation of the god with a fitting burial," Nicholson said. "It's not some sort of blood sacrifice. It's a religious act that's done for the best possible motive." The animal's owner would hope that, by doing this, "some good will come to you," the Wales-based Egyptologist noted. "Maybe you're hoping that the animal will help someone in your family who has died recently (so that) Anubis will take care of that (relative)." Just as Egyptians' view of Anubis, and dogs, has been common knowledge for some time, so too have the dog catacombs of Anubis. This includes a map from 1897 that shows their location clearly marked. Still, most of the focus was on temples outside the catacomb. Until, that is, Nicholson's team -- with the support and help from Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities and sponsorship from National Geographic -- began working on the Saqqara site around 2009 and began exploring deep inside. They found a series of unadorned tunnels, in some cases filled with animal remains and in other cases cleared out. (Nicholson speculated that some may have been taken out for use in fertilizers, as has been done with other animal remains.) Those that they found were wrapped in bandages and mummified, including some with a resin applied. One shouldn't imagine an ornate King Tut, though: They were likely stacked on top of each other and "survived very badly," Nicholson said. "It would be quite difficult to easily find complete, nicely wrapped mummies," he added. "What you have got is the decayed remains of the mummies." To estimate how many there are, the team took a sample and extrapolated from there how many likely filled up the catacomb. One reason the number is so high is because many of the animals were very small; while there some were mature and likely had full lives, Nicholson speculated that some were "being especially bred for the cult." The catacombs are believed to date from between roughly 750 to 30 B.C., up to the time Egypt's society was interacting more and more with those of Europe, including ancient Greece and Rome. A summary of the Cardiff team's findings was published this week in the journal Antiquity. Nicholson and his co-authors, Salima Ikram and Steve Mills, are now working on a more complete study. And the work continues at the Saqqara site, which includes other animal catacombs and many monuments like the step pyramid of Djoser, as well as in laboratories to discover more about the animal remains, such as patterns of sex and age. "We are very curious about where the animals came from," Nicholson said. "We're learning quite a bit about the Egyptians' interactions with animals. It's an exciting thing." Could Egypt's empty animal mummies reveal an ancient scam?  </corpo>

And armed attackers traded heavy gunfire with security guards as they tried to enter the building, said Mohamed Yusuf, spokesman for the Somali Security Ministry. The militant Islamist group Al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the attack, Yusuf said. Yusuf said Somali security forces killed three insurgents. But at least one Somali intelligence official was also killed, he said. Al Shabaab has been designated a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States. It has waged a long insurgency in Somalia.  </corpo>

            <descricao>One South African company has created an ethically-conscious platform for entrepreneurs from the continent.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In the egalitarian world of crowdfunding, most sites are much the same -- largely passive templates for start-ups to vie for investment. While these tools may be advantageous abroad, in Africa... not so much. What works in New York might not necessarily work in Cape Town. Knowing this, one South African company has created an ethically-conscious platform for entrepreneurs from the continent -- and it's leaving its rivals by the wayside in the process. Thundafund, launched by Patrick Schofield in 2013, has seen unprecedented success and spawned a new way of thinking among the crowdfunding community. How? By working closely with entrepreneurs to get the best out of their ideas. "I've seen so many failed dreams," Schofield explains. "People have put their hearts and souls into businesses, their life savings into an idea they think is awesome, only to find out marketers don't like it." But with Thundafund "you actually get to ask the market whether it's a good idea." This in essence is the modus operandi for all crowdfunding sites, and Schofield is forthcoming in his praise for the "fantastic" Kickstarter and Indigogo. Thundafund is different however, explains Jaco Kruger, Managing Director of YBike, who launched a campaign attracting 50,000ZAR ($4,100) of investment in 2013. "Kickstarter doesn't really work in South Africa... it's a difficult market to break in to... It could be said [Kickstarter] is more about making money than empowering people; there's no responsibility towards funding more entrepreneurs. Patrick is providing opportunities and helping communities."  Good ideas are "a dime a dozen" Schofield says, but many South Africans lack the "the skills and resources" to bring their idea through to fruition. New businesses that do receive funding are often saddled with heavy debts or give away significant portions of their company to investors in return for guidance. Whilst the likes of Kickstarter "stand aside" once a campaign is launched according to Kruger, Thundafund has guided its entrepreneurs through the process, optimizing their chance of attracting investors. This involves utilizing multimedia channels and social networks. Schofield stresses the importance of embedded videos as a means of articulating a project's vision, but says online platforms are far from the only path. One campaign in a small community with low levels of internet uptake, reached its funding target by holding talks in the local church and library. "It's not all digital and straightforward," Schofield explains. Indeed, over a third of Thundafund's investors used bank transfers to make pledges. With that in mind the company has limited its scope to national entrepreneurs.  Over 1,400 projects have been submitted so far, with 160 finding their way on to the site. The reason behind the cull is largely due to projects realizing "they're not financially viable" during the collaborative process with Thundafund, Schofield says, or coming to the conclusion that more work needs to be done to make them so. He admits however some shrewd business decisions needed to be made on his part: "We wanted to show that crowdfunding can be successful in South Africa, and to do that we needed success stories." Amongst those is Honest Chocolate, who raised 70,000ZAR ($6,000) to turn their industrial raw chocolate business into a boutique caf√© and shop. "Without the investment it would have been very difficult," explains co-owner Anthony Gird, "we had so many things to put it towards." Key to their campaign was the effective use of incentives for investors, among them chocolate workshops. "Seven months after our launch two people came in saying they'd come to claim their reward for investing. The campaigns have longevity as well." Both Gird and Kruger acknowledge that as well as finance, the crowdfunding process is a fantastic marketing opportunity. "It creates a build up and awareness... your target market is already activated," says Honest Chocolate's co-owner, whilst Y-Bikes, already an established company, "did very well" out of their campaign. Not that the process is easy. "You can't just post and forget about it," Kruger explains. "It's a lot of work," says Gird, "a lot of admin, a lot of bookkeeping... keeping the energy going and keeping people informed." With businesses like Honest Chocolate and Y-Bikes among the 70% of projects achieving sufficient funding, Thundafund has seen plenty of success. In comparison, Kickstarter stands at around 40%, whilst Indigogo's is less than 5%. "There's been a few crowdfunding sites in South Africa that have failed," Kruger says, "and Patrick has made this work. He's building it slow, the way it should be built."  Now that the viability of the platform has been established, Schofield is looking forward to reducing the percentage of successful campaigns and increasing the democratization of the crowdfunding process. But where will that leave South Africa's fledgling start-ups? Schofield has recently launched Ripple, a platform dedicated to community causes and activism. Such campaigns had a strong presence on Thundafund, including the solar powered Sunshine Cinema and one of Schofield's favourites, The Secret Love Project, which manufactured waterproof outfits for Cape Town's homeless, who then had the opportunity to send a message back to their investor. Schofield concedes however that "it can be a bit difficult when you have a charity project sitting next to a business project within the same space," hence the schism. South African entrepreneurs should be far from concerned by the shake-up. In fact, it looks like there will be even more support on the horizon. The two crowdfunding sites will be advised by the Africa Centre, which Schofield describes as "a supportive network for social entrepreneurship... a space for people to ask questions and receive advice," as well as "workshops and one-to-one mentorships." As Kruger says, Schofield is not just a businessman but a tutor within the crowdfunding sector and "that's unique, that's brilliant."  </corpo>

            <descricao>In Cameroon, a fon, or king, can inherit wives from his predecessor. Meet the women who make the man.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Abumbi II, the 11th fon, or king, of Bafut, Cameroon, has close to 100 wives. They weren't all his to start. According to local tradition, when a fon dies, his successor inherits all his wives and then marries his own queens. "The queens have a great role to play in the fondom," notes Prince Nickson, also of Bafut, noting that it is up to these women behind the man to shape him in his kingly role. "Behind every successful man must be a very successful, staunch woman," says Abumbi's third wife, Queen Constance. "Our tradition has it that when you are king, the elderly wives remain to hand down the tradition to the younger wives, and also to teach the king the tradition because the king had been a prince, not a king." Despite the fact that polygamy is legal in Cameroon, the data shows that there are far fewer polygamous marriages across the African continent. The practice is being challenged by changing values, the spread of the Christian faith, the growing appeal of the western way of life but also the rising costs of having large families. It is against this backdrop that Cameroon's traditional rulers must walk the fine line between two often conflicting cultures. "During colonialism other values came in, of governance, different from the traditional values we had and therefore there is this constant conflict between the traditional values and modern western values," admits Fon Abumbi II, who has ruled Bafut, the largest fondom in the region, for 47 years. "My role is to blend them, to find the way forward so my subjects can enjoy the fruits of development and modernity without destroying their culture. Without a culture, you are not a human being, you are an animal. And therefore the chieftaincy institution is the guarantor of our culture." Though polygamy is often met with criticism in the West, there are some who deem it a valuable tradition. After meeting with Fon Abumbi II, Soni Methu, presenter for CNN's Inside Africa, noted that there was more to the practice than meets the eye: "I understand that we might be quick to judge the lifestyle of the kings, but just like in the United Kingdom, African kingdoms and kings are bound to a rich culture and history. (Practices) like inheritance of all your father's wives is nothing but a moral obligation." She also observed that many of these royals are highly accomplished. On meeting the queens of Fon Ndofua Zofia II of Babungo -- one of Cameroon's youngest traditional rulers -- Methu said: "All his young wives, forced on him by tradition, spoke fluent English in a French-speaking region and were great marketers." It is this seeming contradiction that makes life in the fondom fascinating and confusing. Are they stuck in the past or keeping pace with the present? Fon Zofoa III doesn't think you have to choose. He may have "inherited" 72 wives and more than 500 children after his father's death, but he considers himself a very modern king. "To run a kingdom nowadays in this era, you must be educated because things are moving very fast. Like they used to say, education is light, ignorance is darkness."

            <corpo>(CNN)The message was crushingly loud and clear: Stop the illicit ivory trade. And to highlight it, the United States destroyed more than a ton of elephant ivory in New York's Times Square on Friday. Lawmakers, wildlife officials, conservationists and bystanders watched the ivory turn into sand-like powder as an industrial rock crusher descended on carvings and raw tusks. "Today, we are not just crushing illegally poached ivory; we are crushing the bloody ivory market," said Cristian Samper, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society. "We are crushing any hopes by the poachers that they will profit by killing off our Earth's majestic elephants. Criminals, take notice."  Poaching is reducing elephant populations at an alarming rate, and the numbers are getting especially grim in Africa, where most of the giant animals are targeted. "Elephant poaching is at its highest level in decades and now exceeds the species' reproductive potential," said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which organized the Times Square crushing. The illegal ivory trade has doubled worldwide since 2007, with the United States among the largest markets for illegally acquired ivory. Two years ago, the United States crushed a six-ton stockpile of elephant ivory in Denver, the first time it has destroyed such large quantities. Other nations followed suit, including the Philippines, Kenya and Gabon, which have destroyed large quantities in recent years.  Most of the ivory crushed Friday was confiscated during undercover operations nationwide. They included ivory seized from a Philadelphia art dealer who pleaded guilty in federal court to smuggling African elephant ivory into the country. African elephants are listed as threatened under the endangered species act. Even though some African elephant ivory, including lawfully hunted trophies, can be imported into the country, the United States prohibits commercial imports and strictly regulates domestic trade of ivory products, wildlife officials said. Poaching, shrinking habitats and a seemingly insatiable appetite for ivory in Asia -- particularly in China -- have contributed to the disappearing populations of elephants. About 35,000 elephants are poached annually as the demand for ivory grows. Glenn Close opinion: Intelligent animals marked for death  </corpo>

            <descricao>A smuggler boat captain who trafficks children into Europe explains why he does and why he blames the kids' parents.</descricao>
            <corpo>Burj Mughayzil, Egypt (CNN)On a sandy beach in one of the many inlets dotting Egypt's Mediterranean coastline two men are standing off to one side watching us interview families whose children have been trafficked into Europe. Eventually the taller of them begins to jump in. He starts shouting and explaining why he works on the smuggler boats carrying the human cargo into Europe. "What does the government do for us? We're fishermen but there's nothing to catch." The village, Burj Mughayzil, is essentially a smugglers' village. By their own count 2,000 young men and boys have disappeared. Some as young as 11 and 12, they are lured by the European dream -- but so many of them either end up in Italian jails accused of crewing the smuggling ships or killed in the crossing. We were hoping somewhere on the beach to find a crewman on a smuggling ship, someone who had made the journey and returned. We found two; the tall man and his slimmer friend, who told us they were a ship's mate and a captain. When I asked if they'd talk on camera they agreed. To our surprise they both asked to show their faces and to give their names. CNN has retraced the route traveled by the children from small villages on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, across the sea to Sicily by boat, then making their way to the Italian capital, Rome, where they fall victim to drug and prostitution rings. Thousands of children are risking their lives, falling prey to traffickers, for the dream of a better future for them and their families. Captain Mahmoud and Mohammed told us: "We work the ships. Me and a crew of 15 people. If the [Egyptian] government was helping us in any way we wouldn't be crossing in any way." The trips can take up to nine days on the open seas. The Egyptian Government says it has increased its vigilance along the coastline but still the smugglers are finding ways out. Sometimes he says, 20 boys are crammed on a tiny fishing boat fitted with an onboard motor, so they can be brought out to sea where he and his crew wait on a bigger boat which holds up to 600 people. 'It's risky for the boat and for everyone on it. We could be sentenced to 25 years or be executed if anything happens, God forbid, to anyone on board if it becomes a death trip." He also risks years in an Italian jail on the other side and a 15,000 euro ($17,000) fine for every single person on board. The fine can stretch into the millions, Italian authorities say. It's a risk he knowingly takes. Though, the captain says, leaving him and his men "to rot in jail," is not the solution. "There are big fish and there are small fish. The small fish are the ones who are in Italian jails. The big fish live freely here in Egypt, freely in Italy." Many of the parents claim it is the children themselves who want to go -- but teens we spoke to in Italy say their families expect them to work once they get to Europe and to send money home. Others admit Europe is seen as a way of earning the family much-needed cash but they say they didn't know about the trafficker gangs behind the smuggling routes. Yet others say they were deceived by the smugglers who make empty promises of opportunity across the Med. Authorities in both countries are clear, they say the parents are guilty -- at the very least -- of abandoning their children. The smugglers, Captain Mahmoud says, are very brazen. "We leave here at dusk, dawn, whenever. It doesn't matter if you know you are risking jail anyway. We'll have been paid -- us and the crew - 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,300) each. That feeds a crewman's family and kids for a month. Then after that, who knows? Risk it again or die of hunger." Egyptian minors have been flooding into Italy by the thousands according to the Italian Ministry of Labor, taking advantage of Italian laws that grant state protection to those under 18 who arrive in Italy unaccompanied. It's not just the passengers that are underage though; his crew often is as well. Captain Mahmoud says they are pressured by their families. "People here in this village, they're selling their kids. They think, 'we're 10 [people] and we can't find enough to eat. When we're nine, we can eat a little better. If we're eight, we can eat even better still. If two get locked up? Better than we all die together.' All the people in Italian jails? They're the victims of the parents here who can't afford to eat." I asked if they felt a responsibility for the people making the crossing, for those who have died. "How can we not?" he said. "If anything happens to them, it happens to us. If the ship sinks we drown together." His tall friend, Mohammed, talks over him, "How can we not be sad? These are our cousins, our brothers. I still see their faces." At the end of the interview Captain Mahmoud asks again if we're going to broadcast this, if his government will see this. I tell him, yes, we will. Good, he says. Let them hear the truth.

            <corpo>(CNN)Guatemala's President will be investigated in a corruption probe and could be stripped of immunity that protects him from prosecution. The Central American nation's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that President Otto Perez Molina should be investigated and asked the country's lawmakers to lift the President's immunity. The Supreme Court's ruling comes more than a month after Guatemalan Vice President Roxana Baldetti stepped down amid a customs corruption scandal. The Guatemalan Congress will name a commission that will conduct the investigation into Perez Molina, which was requested by an opposition party. A spokesman for Perez Molina said the President would respect the law as the investigation moves forward, the state-run AGN news agency reported. Perez Molina, a retired military general who campaigned on promises to use an "iron fist" to fight crime, won the presidential election in 2011. In recent months, he's faced mounting criticism at home as his Cabinet faces a slew of corruption scandals.

            <descricao>When it comes to Colombia, Brazilian forward Neymar isn't having much luck.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)When it comes to Colombia, Brazilian forward Neymar isn't having much luck. During the 2014 World Cup, the Barcelona star fractured his vertebra after he was kneed in the back during a collision with a Colombian player in the quarterfinals, ruling him out of the rest of the tournament. Fast forward to the Copa America and it was Colombia's midfield enforcer Carlos Sanchez -- nicknamed "The Rock" like Dwayne Johnson's wrestling character -- who blunted the skillful Neymar during Brazil's 1-0 defeat by their South American rivals. But it got it even worse -- as Neymar hit rock bottom and was sent off after kicking a ball at an opponent after the referee's whistle had gone before appearing to launch an attempted headbutt at an opponent. Sanchez, who plays his football with Aston Villa in England won all the plaudits, though he thankfully refrained from dropping the famous "People's Elbow." But his performance went down a storm on social media with users lining up to heap praise on the Colombian. Sanchez inspired Colombia to its first victory over Brazil since 1991 as it gained revenge for last year's World Cup quarterfinal defeat. Jeison Murillo scored the only goal of the game after 36 minutes. Colombia was also reduced to 10 men late on when Carlos Bacca was sent off for shoving Neymar during the frenzy. The defeat was Brazil's first under coach Carlos Dunga and its first in 12 games. Brazil faces Venezuela in its final group game on Sunday while Colombia takes on Peru.

            <corpo>(CNN)Hurricane Blanca is churning in the Pacific toward Mexico's Baja California coast, where it is expected to make landfall. Blanca has maximum sustained winds of 175 kilometers per hour (110 mph). "The center of Blanca will approach the southwest coast of the Baja California peninsula later today and move near or along the coast tonight and Monday," the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Puerto San Andresito to Punta Abreojos. By early Sunday, Blanca was about 355 kilometers (220 miles) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, where a hurricane watch is in effect. "Maximum sustained winds have decreased ... with higher gusts," the hurricane Center said. "Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Blanca is expected to weaken to a tropical storm tonight before it reaches the southwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula." Blanca is forecast to be downgraded to a tropical depression Monday night.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Lionel Messi has urged his teammates to improve in Tuesday's Copa America clash with Uruguay after Argentina "fell asleep" against Paraguay. Messi's men blew a two-goal lead, drawing 2-2 in their opening Group B match of the South American championship in Chile, while titleholder Uruguay won 1-0 against guest nation Jamaica. "We played well in the first half, but we fell asleep in the second," said Messi, who scored a 36th-minute penalty soon after Sergio Aguero's opener in La Serena. Nelson Valdez reduced the deficit from long range on the hour mark and substitute Lucas Barrios snatched an equalizer in the final minute of regulation time. "We should have put the game to bed," said captain Messi, who came into the tournament after winning a treble of titles with European and Spanish champion Barcelona. "In the first half we completely dominated possession, but in the second Paraguay took the ball away from us. "Obviously it's frustrating to be held to a draw after being 2-0 up, but we have to move on, think about Uruguay and improve. We have to keep the ball a bit more and manage the game." Uruguay beat its larger neighbor Argentina on penalties in the quarterfinals on the way to winning the last Copa in 2011, but could only reach the round of 16 of the 2014 World Cup -- where Messi's side lost in the final. When they contested the World Cup qualifiers, Argentina won the home match 3-2 but lost 3-2 in Uruguay. Veteran midfielder Cristian Rodriguez netted the only goal against Jamaica in Antofagasta, as the Caribbean side acquitted itself well on debut in the tournament. Mexico is the other guest nation, making its ninth appearance. It drew 0-0 in its Group A opener against Bolivia on Friday. On Sunday, Venezuela caused a shock by beating 2014 World Cup quarterfinalist Colombia 1-0 in Rancagua thanks to a 60th-minute header from striker Jose Salomon Rondon, who plays for Russian champion Zenit St. Petersburg. Brazil was to take on Peru in the second Group C match in Temuco.  In Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifiers, titleholder Spain stayed second in Group C with a 1-0 win in Belarus. David Silva scored the only goal at the end of the first half as coach Vicente del Bosque celebrated 100 games in charge. Slovakia has a three-point advantage after six of 10 games, having beaten Macedonia 2-1 at home, while third-placed Ukraine kept alive its hopes of a top-two finish by beating Luxembourg 3-0. England stayed six points clear at the top of Group E, winning 3-2 in Slovenia thanks to a late goal from captain Wayne Rooney and a spectacular double from midfielder Jack Wilshere. Second-placed Switzerland also came from behind to win 2-1 in Lithuania, as Xherdan Shaqiri netted an 84th-minute decider. Austria maintained a four-point lead in Group G as striker Marc Janko scored the only goal away to third-placed Russia.

            <cabecalho>Nacho Figueras: World's most photographed man? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The polo-playing Ralph Lauren model is friends with Princes Harry and William and was once voted the world's second most handsome man.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Nacho Figueras. The chances are you won't know the name but most likely you'll recognize the face. It stares out at you from the pages of countless magazines and adorns billboards across the planet as the face of luxury fashion brand Polo Ralph Lauren. Figueras is polo's answer to David Beckham, a sporting icon in his native Argentina who transcends his day job as a professional polo player. He is friends with Princes William and Harry, was once voted the world's second most handsome man by Vanity Fair magazine (behind the actor Robert Pattinson) and has appeared in the TV series "Gossip Girl." In addition, he runs his own polo horse-breeding program in Argentina -- breeding between 70 and 80 horses each year -- and uses his status for wide-ranging charity work. Of the Beckham analogy, he says: "I don't know if that's true. The comparison maybe comes from how much Beckham has done to promote football in the world. He has become a person that transcends football. "You have Lionel Messi as the best footballer on the planet but he plays football, goes home, trains. For Messi, football is his work but Beckham's work is broader than that. He and his wife are obviously very connected in the fashion world." Figueras is well aware of his omnipresence in waiting rooms, magazine stalls and airports the world over. Speaking to CNN in a phone interview from California where he is currently playing polo, he says without a hint of arrogance: "It's very rare that you open a magazine and I'm not in it in one of the photographs." But don't make the mistake of calling Figueras a model. "I'm not a model, I'm a polo player," he says, describing the Ralph Lauren work as endorsements and marking himself as a brand ambassador rather than a model. "Models are on the catwalk." The Argentinian's path into such side work began at the behest of the celebrated photographer Bruce Weber, who introduced Figueras, at the time playing polo in the Hamptons, to Ralph Lauren himself back in 1999. A year later, he started working for Ralph Lauren before becoming the face of Ralph Lauren Black Label in 2005. He has been under contract with the American company ever since. He readily admits that his connections with the brand have opened doors for him, allowing him to become increasingly involved in charity work perhaps most notably with Sentebale, a charity co-founded by Prince Harry, which helps poverty-stricken children in Lesotho. Through that work and their shared love of polo, he has spent a lot of time with both British princes although is reluctant to overplay their relationship. "That's something you'll have to ask them," he says to the question of whether he calls them friends. "I love working with Harry with the charity, to be able to give back. "Both are very committed at giving back and polo is a good platform for them to do that as they've grown up with the sport." Both brothers are accomplished players, says Figueras -- Harry an attacking player, William more strong defensively -- "as they played since they were little, they're very good." As for Figueras, his own standards have slipped a little. Where once he was handicapped eight (10 is the highest in the sport,) he is now a six but still rates among the world's top 100 players and, two years shy of his 40th birthday, has no plans to retire from the sport. "Polo is No. 1, it's what I do," he adds. "It's still 90/95% of my time and I'm still a young guy, okay, maybe not as young but still young so I want to play. "I grew up playing polo and at 14/15 years old I decided I wanted to get serious about it. To start with, I loved the speed and adrenalin but now the horses are the big part of it for me." That love of horses has spawned into his breeding program, Cria Yatay, from which he can sell the very best horses for up to $100,000, although its day-to-day running is left to others. In contrast to the U.S. and the United Kingdom where polo tends to be the reserve of the elite, polo in Argentina is more accessible to those from a wide range of backgrounds. And his world renown has given him a certain amount of notoriety back in Argentina, although he laughs at any parallels drawn between him and Argentina's No.1 sporting icon. "In Argentina, football is king and he's the leading player," says Figueras. "I don't think you can compare any athlete to Messi, he's just on a different level. Polo is big in Argentina but Messi is huge." Read: Can drones revolutionize polo  </corpo>

            <descricao>Brazilian great Zico is the latest former professional footballer intent on succeeding FIFA president Sepp Blatter.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Brazilian great Zico is the latest former professional footballer intent on succeeding FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Frenchman David Ginola and Portugal's Luis Figo both threw their hats into the ring ahead of last month's presidential election, only to both ultimately pull out of the race. Blatter went on to be re-elected for a fifth term, before announcing his resignation following the launch of separate investigations by the U.S. and Swiss authorities into alleged corruption within FIFA. The election of Blatter's successor is believed to be set for December, and former Brazil star Zico, whose full name is Arthur Antunes Coimbra, wants to shake up the way world football is run. "I would like to confirm the decision to be a candidate," Zico told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro. "I feel I am capable. For sure, certain rules need to change. "It's sad for our sport to see what is happening in football today -- the corruption... and the hard work of many other good people wasted. "I see it as my duty to use my experience and knowledge to try and stand for the presidency." Former France international Ginola, whose bid was controversially backed by betting company Paddy Power, withdrew from the presidential race in January after failing to receive the backing of five football federations required to stand in the election. The 48-year-old Ginola, however, has said in the wake of Blatter's resignation that he wants to put himself forward once again. Ex-Portugal captain Figo, meanwhile, pulled out just a week before the election, referring to the process as "a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man -- something I refuse to go along with." Zico, who represented his nation at three World Cups but never won the competition, admits he may also struggle to gather enough support like his fellow ex-professionals. "That need to have five federations behind you, I think that is where the corruption starts," said the Brazilian. "Of course, changes in the rules of the game would be necessary. Mainly because with the rules in place now there isn't the slightest possibility [of being elected]." Zico has little administrative experience in the world of football but said it was after speaking to Figo that he decided to stand for the role of FIFA president. "I was asked if I had talked with Figo about his being a candidate for FIFA," he said. "I said I had and that set me thinking." Considered one of Brazil's greatest ever players, Zico played most of his club football with Brazilian side Flamengo, before moving to play in Italy and Japan. The 62-year-old has also coached all over the world, taking charge of the Japan and Iraq national teams as well as the likes of Turkish side Fenerbahce and Russian club CSKA Moscow.  Meanwhile FIFA has handed over computer data to the Swiss authorities following a raid of the governing body's headquarters. Swiss authorities opened an investigation into corruption involving the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups last month. The Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) spokesperson confirmed the seizure of IT data to CNN. "Today, FIFA handed over seized IT Data to the OAG," a statement read. "As already communicated, the OAG has opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown. "The OAG is currently analyzing seized data and information. The OAG won't go into details as criminal proceedings are still under way." Reportedly Blatter is believed to be among those whose office was involved in the raid, while data from the offices of secretary general Jerome Valcke and the organization's financial chief Markus Kattner is also said to have been released to Swiss police.  Emirates CEO Tim Clark has also spoken out about his company's decision not to renew its sponsorship deal with FIFA in November. Clark said Emirates chose not to renew with FIFA because the commercial terms were not right, but added it could make a U-turn when Blatter departs and "if things are sorted out in FIFA." "We are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the fallout over the last few weeks," Clark told CNN's Richard Quest. "It is a big pity, the big loser of course is football. Let's hope we can get it back onto some kind of track, it becomes the beautiful sport that it is, the sponsors are back in competing against each other to get on the tournament, because it is a hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure, but it's worth it." A number of current FIFA sponsors have warned the governing body to clean up its act in light of the corruption scandal, while Sony last week demanded an investigation into allegations over the controversial awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Women's World Cup: Marta breaks scoring record - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Marta breaks the Women's World Cup scoring record with her 15th goal at the tournament.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)She's possibly the greatest soccer player you've never heard of. Marta has won virtually every individual and team honor available throughout her illustrious career -- and now the Brazilian has another record to add to her collection. Her penalty in Tuesday's 2-0 win over South Korea at the 2015 Women's World Cup propelled her to the top of the tournament's all-time goalscorer list with 15 goals. She surpassed retired Germany international Brigit Prinz and went two ahead of current USWNT star Abby Wambach who, at 35 years of age, is surely playing in her last World Cup. It was fitting that her record-breaking goal came from the penalty spot against South Korea, 12 years after her first for Brazil at a World Cup -- which, incidentally, was also a penalty against the same opposition. However, the one major trophy to evade the 29-year-old has been the World Cup. Widely regarded as the best female footballer of all time, can she really be considered the greatest ever without winning football's biggest prize? It is a question often asked about Argentina star Lionel Messi. Although, Marta has an international record and Ballon d'Or haul that would make even Messi's eyes water. Her goal on Tuesday took her to an incredible 92 goals in 93 matches for her country, while she has five FIFA World Player of the Year awards which came in consecutive years between 2006 and 2010. Often referred to as "the female Pele" -- and by Pele himself as "Pele with skirts" -- Marta has long been an advocate for equality in women's football. "I think it has changed a bit but that mentality still exists," she told CNN in 2013. "There's still prejudice and that resistance regarding women not only on female football but in various activities. "Men think that women are a bit fragile to perform some types of activities or don't have the ability and aren't strong enough. "That doesn't exist anymore. Women have shown they have capabilities in every sense better than men a lot of time, but it's that whole macho thing. "Football in Brazil is seen as a masculine sport, even with a lot of people accepting the female sport. There's still a percentage that thinks like in the old days." Despite there being undoubtedly a long way to go, a lot of progress has been made. In the USA, 3.3 million people tuned in to watch their team's opener against Australia, more than tripling the viewing figures from the first game at the previous World Cup. Similarly in England, television viewers peaked at 2.4 million during the country's 1-0 defeat against France, almost double the 1.3 million that watched them during the European Championship in 2013. Perhaps the most impressive figure came from the host nation Canada, whose 1.8 million viewers during their team's tournament opener against China made it the most watched Women's World Cup match ever in the country. "There is hope for the future," Marta said two years ago. With her exceptional talents and record-breaking achievements, she certainly forms a large part of that hope.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A Brazilian man crooned and strummed his guitar while undergoing brain surgery in his home country. Anthony Kullkamp Dias, 33, sang six songs while the doctors performed surgery to remove his brain tumor, according to the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceicao. Dias played "Yesterday" by the Beatles, a few Brazilian songs and an original number called "Emanuel," which he dedicated to his son. He was awake and talking during the surgery to monitor and map the brain for possible injuries to areas that control motor function and speech, which might be affected by the removal of the tumor, doctors said. In an interview with CNN affiliate TV Globo, Dias said he found out about his brain tumor a few days before his son was born. The idea to play the guitar and sing during the surgery came the day before he was wheeled into the operating room. The banker has played the guitar for 20 years, and also plays the accordion, keyboards, trumpet and the flute. Dr. Jean Abreu Machado, the anesthesiologist and clinical director at the hospital, said the brain tissue does not have sensors to pain. However, the skin and other surrounding tissue do, causing an interesting challenge to doctors on how to "keep the patient awake and pain-free." Dias said he felt no pain and they removed 90% of his tumor.    </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)It's a shame the Women's World Cup doesn't get the love the men's does. You're so missing out. The women play with a hunger that million-dollar prima donnas (read: Ronaldo) just can't always muster. The games aren't always a foregone conclusion (Long-shots like Australia can surprise you here). And your team can actually win this thing. (We're talking to you, U.S. and England). The tournament began Sunday and runs until July 5. The U.S. takes on Australia at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday. Still not convinced? Let us dispel some more doubts, so you'll give Women's World Cup a shot.  You know how some Americans complain that soccer's boring because there are so few goals? Not here. In the opener yesterday, Norway beat Thailand 4-0. And how many goals did Germany score against the goalless Ivory Coast? TEN! Yes, 10!  You know how in men's soccer, a strong wind is enough to knock a player over. And they play-act like a babies? The women don't have time for that. According to a study, women fake injury half as much as men do. And when they are on the ground rolling around, they're back up 30 seconds faster than men.  You know what the big controversy was, ahead of the 2014 men's World Cup in Brazil? In six of the 12 cities that hosted the games, the quality of the grass was poor and could really injure a player. Oh boo hoo! At least the men had grass. The women will play their games on synthetic turf. Turf burns are brutal. Legs are going to get beat up.  If you're an American, then get behind Team USA. While the men's team has made much progress, the women have won the World Cup not once (1991) but twice (1999) and came so close four years ago. Remember that iconic pic of Brandi Chastain celebrating? That was her after scoring the winning penalty kick against China, when she became every girl's soccer hero. If you're a Brit, your women's team could also make you proud (unlike Rooney and the boys). Plus, they're in a relatively easy group. And if you're German, your guys already won the men's World Cup last year. Why not make it a two-fer? Your gals are ranked #1 in the world.  We'll admit, it's hard to top Luis Suarez chomping down on an opponent. And that's a good thing in the women's game. It keeps the 'beautiful game' beautiful. But women's soccer has its share of drama. Remember this epic hair pull? Or what about when Colombia's Lady Andrade left a shiner on U.S.' Abby Wambach during the London Olympics?  Messi. Tevez. Neymar. You know them all. And you should. They're really, really good. You know who else is good? Abby Wambach. How good? Well, she's scored more goals for a national team than any other player in soccer history. And that includes women and men. Then there's Brazil's Marta, nicknamed "Pele with a skirt." Slightly sexist, we know. But it's meant as a compliment. She was named FIFA Woman's Player of the Year five times. She's yet to win a World Cup and you can bet, she'll be giving it her all.

            <corpo>(CNN)Note to Chile star Arturo Vidal -- next time you have a drink, it's probably best to pay for a taxi, rather than jump into your Ferrari and speed down a freeway. The overwhelming reaction on social media to Vidal following his drink-driving car crash on Tuesday -- bar a few vocal supporters outside court during his trial -- has been one of condemnation. Many asked just why is it that so many footballers appear to enjoy special dispensation whatever they do. Despite being the Copa America's top scorer and so far almost single-handedly dragging Chile to the top of its group, few Chileans have backed coach Jorge Sampaoli's decision not to exclude him from the squad. One tweeted: "Vidal... with your salary of $8 millions a year. You couldn't spend $50 on a taxi? I love you... but for f***'s sake." Journalist Manuel de Tezanos added: "No double standards. Seeing how our politicians ask for forgiveness, I applaud Vidal. But that doesn't change what I would have done: taken him out." TV and radio journalist Claudio Bustios tweeted: "We can think what we like. In favor or against. Nothing matters. The players will continue doing what they please." The Chilean media was equally unsympathetic, leading with headlines such as "The broken Cup" and "The dream crashed." By the look of the photographs, Vidal had a very lucky escape after he was involved in the crash Tuesday. One side of Vidal's red shining Ferrari has almost been completely ripped away. Multiple media reports quote the Chilean National Police, and prosecutors, as saying that the football star had been under the influence of alcohol, and was at fault for the crash. After a court hearing Wednesday, a judge ruled the 28-year-old Vidal will have his license withheld and will need to report monthly to the Chilean consulate in Milan, while the investigation into the crash will go on for 120 days, the Chilean judicial system confirmed. In a YouTube video posted on his Twitter account, the Chile midfielder, who plays for Italian club Juventus, confirmed he had been involved in a collision and said nobody had been injured and that it, "wasn't his fault." Vidal added, "I'm fine, my family is fine. Thank you for everything." But that's unlikely to be end of the matter. The Chile national police was not immediately available for comment when CNN contacted them, but Police reportedly say he was impaired. The Hospital San Luis de Buin confirmed to CNN that Vidal had been there but would not disclose the nature of his injuries. "The driver of the red vehicle was under the influence of alcohol," the Chilean national police chief Colonel Ricardo Gonzalez was quoted as telling a number of media. News website La Tercera reported Vidal's wife suffered a dislocated elbow in the collision, which involved three vehicles. Radio BioBio said Vidal's vehicle was a few meters from dropping into the Los Guindos path, which is a drop of 10 meters, and that his car's airbags had been activated. Prosecutor Luis Pablo Cortes was quoted as telling news website Emol that Vidal was the protagonist of the crash and that a driver from one of the cars involved had been let free, but will be called to testify as a witness. CNN tried unsuccessfully to reach him. Read: Is FIFA facing 'doomsday' scenario? He said Vidal was detained for driving in a "drunk state," which under Chilean law is a more serious offense that being "under the influence" of alcohol. After playing for Juventus in the European Champions League final on June 6, Vidal returned to Chile, which is hosting the Copa America -- Latin America's leading international football tournament. He is the tournament's top scorer with three goals from two games, guiding Chile to a win and a draw. Given his importance to the Chile team, Vidal's involvement in the crash, has brought some withering criticism from local media pundits. "[Vidal] f***ed over his teammates, coach, shirt &amp;, most seriously, those who dream of the Copa," tweeted De Tezanos. "There's 17m of us." "It's very serious to let this happen right in the middle of the Copa Am√©rica," Jos√© Sulantay, a former coach of Chile's Under-20 team who worked with Vidal, told CNN Chile. "This kind of stuff doesn't happen [when they're playing] in Europe. I don't understand coach Jorge Sampaoli and I don't understand Vidal." However, in a media conference Wednesday, Sampaoli said he had no intention of excluding Vidal from Chile's squad. "It doesn't seem right to me to exclude someone just for making a mistake," said the Chile coach. The crash reportedly took place in Buin, around 40km south of Santiago and Vidal was taken to the San Luis de Buin hospital for treatment. Chile has a "zero tolerance" approach to drink driving, meaning there is no maximum limit for alcohol. Vidal could face three years in jail, and a driving ban. It's believed to be his first offense. He is more likely to receive a driving ban of two years, as there were no serious injuries and it's his first offense. The Copa America host faces Bolivia in its final group stage game on Friday.

            <corpo>Havana, Cuba (CNN)Ernest Hemingway's home near Havana is expected to soon receive an infusion of badly needed building supplies from the United States. An American foundation restoring the legendary writer's home in Cuba on Saturday signed an agreement with the Cuban government to -- for the first time -- import construction materials directly from the United States to aid the preservation efforts. The joint U.S.-Cuban project will build a workshop adjacent to Hemingway's home in Cuba to restore and maintain thousands of the famed writer's documents, rough drafts and letters. "It's historic, not since the 1950s has a building with American materials been built here," said Mary-Jo Adams, the executive director of the Boston-based Finca Vigia Foundation, which is named for the writer's Cuban home where he wrote his Nobel-prize winning book "The Old Man and the Sea." In an interview with CNN in Havana, Adams said the foundation has received approval from the U.S. and Cuban governments to bring $860,000 worth of supplies from the United States for the new construction. In January, as part of a shift in US policy towards Cuba, President Barack Obama authorized the exportation of building materials to the island for the first time since the United States broke relations with the island following Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution. Adams said Hemingway's love for Cuba created a rare area where the U.S. and Cuban governments could cooperate, despite still present Cold War-era tensions. For the last 22 years of Hemingway's life his home near Havana was his base for marathon stretches of writing, drinking and fishing. From the hillside residence, he entertained fellow writers, diplomats and Hollywood stars. Hemingway left Cuba in 1961, shortly before the United States and Cuba severed diplomatic ties. Suffering from depression, Hemingway committed suicide in Idaho the same year. Saving Hemingway's home in Cuba His widow, Mary, donated the house to Cuban government, which displays Hemingway's books, clothing and even a collection of fermented lizards. But Cuba's punishing climate was gradually destroying the house and in 2005, the Finca Vigia Foundation began to work with Cuban government to save Hemingway's home. The U.S. trade embargo on Cuba tied up the collaboration in red tape, but Adams said the warming of relations now promises to speed up the restoration of the house and writings. "It's a whole different climate now," she said. As part of the restoration project, foundation experts have already preserved and scanned thousands of Hemingway's documents, including the writer's correspondence, hand-written cooking recipes and early drafts of his books. "Hemingway was a pack rat," Adams said. "He wrote a lot of letters and often he slept on them and never sent them. It provides a glimpse into his thought process." The restored documents remain in Cuba but the foundation transports the scanned copies back to Boston where they are on display at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston. Adams said the planned documentation restoration workshop will include climate-controlled areas to store the preserved writings and protect them from further damage. She said the foundation hoped to bring the entire facility piece-by-piece to Cuba from Florida by 2016. "We will need to send a tremendous amount of tools over here," Adams said. "Hammers, screwdrivers, nails, nuts, bolts. Everything, we send needs to have all the corresponding parts. We are under no illusions that there is a Home Depot in Cuba."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>10 of the world's most amazing long-distance trails  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Craving dehydrated food and days without washing? These epic hikes are for you.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Long distance trails inspire contradictory tales of solitude and camaraderie, deserted river beds and mountain plateaus, pleasure and pain. The idea of covering thousands of miles on foot is itself barely believable. Perhaps that's what makes these adventures so memorable. Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her 1,000-mile trek along the U.S. Pacific Crest Trail was so enthralling it made it to Hollywood. "Wild," a film based on her account and starring Reese Witherspoon, was one of the most talked about releases at the end of 2014, with Witherspoon even nominated for a best actress award at the 2015 Golden Globes. If you'd like a piece of that action, or simply crave dehydrated food, days without washing and multiple, life-threatening encounters, then here are 10 other epic hikes ripe for big screen treatment. Who would play you? The Appalachian (United States) Distance: 3,510 kilometers (2,180 miles) The Appalachian is the grand dame of long-distance trails. One third of North America's holy hiking trinity, the Triple Crown -- the others being the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails -- it's the most iconic, famed for its "thru hikers" who attempt to complete it in a single season. Its 5 million steps follow the Appalachian Mountains from Mount Springer, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine. The range was once a natural border to the 13 colonies held by powerful Native American tribes like the Iroquois and Cherokee, before independence gave rise to westward expansion. Among the highlights: the idyllic, overgrown tracks through Great Smokey Mountains National Park in North Carolina, North America's most diverse forest. More information at: Appalachiantrail.org The South West Coast Path (UK) Distance: 1,016 kilometers (630 miles) The UK's longest National Trail is a stroll in the park compared to some of the other walks on our list, but what it lacks in longevity it makes up for in history. This dramatic coastal route from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole Harbour in Dorset, takes hikers around the tip of Cornwall, crisscrossing two World Heritage Sites including the famed Jurassic Coast. Nicknamed for its 240-million-year-old rocks, these prehistoric cliffs feature spectacular formations like Durdle Door and Ladram Bay. And while it may be shorter you'll still have to climb a total of 114,931 feet (35,031 meters or four times the height of Everest) to finish it. More information: Southwestcoastpath.com Te Araroa (New Zealand) Distance: 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) With a backdrop straight out of Middle Earth -- glacial ridges, windswept headlands, shires -- New Zealand's landscape doesn't disappoint. Te Araroa (Maori for "The long pathway") covers most of it; all the way from Cape Regina in the North to Bluff on the southern tip. "Tramping" the length of it, as the Kiwis would say, from the gentle bays of Queen Charlotte to the volcanic Mount Tongariro, takes about three months. Still, even at a fast pace you could be overtaken be overtaken. Ultramarathon runner Jezz Bragg completed it in a fantastical time of 53 days. More information: Teararoa.org.nz Continental Divide Trail (United States) Distance: 4,990 kilometers (3,100 miles) The third and longest installment of The Triple Crown is really a director's cut -- loved by serious trail enthusiasts but not for everyone. Spanning 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada along the Rocky Mountain spine of North America, it takes hikers across some arduous but spectacular terrain including the Red Desert dunes of Wyoming and the heights of Grays Peak (14,270 feet/4,350 meters) in Colorado. The standout feature is Triple Divide Peak in Montana, where the rain runs three ways to the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Arctic via Hudson Bay. Only 150 people attempt to thru-hike the trail each year. The youngest to complete it was 13-year-old Reed Gjonnes. More information: Continentaldividetrail.org Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker Historical Trail (Sudan-Uganda) Distance: 805 kilometers (500 miles) Trail blazers have recaptured the spirit of discovery with this historic route, which retraces the expedition of Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker's -- the first Europeans to set eyes on Lake Albert and name it after Queen Victoria's late husband -- to that great African lake, 150 years ago. Starting near Juba, in South Sudan, the greater part runs through Uganda to Baker's View, over Lake Albert, and takes in natural wonders like Murchison Falls, which break the Nile with a 141-foot (43 meter) drop as it flows to Lake Victoria. More info: Thebakertrail.com Oregon Desert Trail (United States) Distance: 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) The Oregon High Desert is a thrilling, stark arena in which to test your mettle. The route is a moveable feast of shorter trails, historic wagon roads and swathes of wilderness to pioneer as you desire, or "bushwhack," as hiking enthusiasts call it. Not for the inexperienced, the isolation and scarcity of water over long sections pose a serious challenge, requiring significant backup resources. But it's not all desolation. There's a quiet beauty to the landscape, which blooms wherever there's moisture. The truly remote, red-rock Owyhee Canyonlands seem to crumble away as you wander through. More information: Onda.org Grand Italian Trail, Sentiero Italia (Italy) Distance: 6,166 kilometers (3,830 miles) There are "Great" trails and even "Greater" trails. The Sentiero is best described as "Grand." It's an indulgent, convalescent tour traversing the entire Alpine arc before shimmying down the Apennine chain to Sicily and finally drifting west across the Tyrrhenian to Sardinia and Santa Teresa Gallura -- site of the ancient city of Tibula. The route was forged in 1995 by the first Walk Italy event and gives not so much a taste but a full five courses of La Dolce Vita: from the majestic Dolomites, via rich Tuscan vineyards, to the jaw-dropping splendor of the Amalfi Coast. With such varied terrain and the sheer distances involved a thru-hike takes considerable planning and roughly eight months to complete. More information: Traildino.com Great Himalayan Trail (Nepal) Distance: 1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) In a word: ambitious. Still being put together, when finished, this 4,500 kilometer (2,796 mile) skyscraping traverse will be the longest and highest mountain trail in the world, crossing the entire Himalaya range from Kashmir to Tibet, via India, Nepal and Bhutan. Nepal's section is the most complete and it alone offers one of the great trekking challenges. It's split into Low and High routes that run near parallel, beginning either side of Kanchenjunga Base Camp and ending on the Tibetan border in Humla. For high culture, the low route (still averaging 2,000 meters in height) passes through remote Nepali villages dotted along the hills and valleys. Only those with mountaineering experience should attempt the high route -- it peaks at a breathless 6,146 meters (20,164 feet). More information: Thegreathimalayatrail.org Hokkaido Nature Trail (Japan) Distance: 4,585 kilometers (2,849 miles) Japan is something of a distance-walking paradise, home to five of the world's 10 longest trails. At 2,849 miles and growing, this is the longest and last of them all, exploring the glaciers, forests and steaming, volcanic mountains of Hokkaido. Japan's northernmost island is roughly the size of Austria, with short balmy summers and long, cold winters. A complete tour takes seven months and is best divided by either side of winter. More information: Walkjapan.com Trans Panama Trail (Panama) Distance: 800 kilometers (497 miles) Anyone who has hiked in the tropics will testify to the difficult conditions. Sweaty, dense jungles, swarms of mosquitoes and numerous other bloodsucking creatures await and that's before you even begin this 500-mile journey. But the rewards are greater for those challenges. This cross-Panama route takes hikers from the border in Colombia to Costa Rica, and promises encounters with remote indigenous tribes like the Kuna and Embera. Hikers have a chance to canoe backwaters banked with lush rainforest and explore paths carved by conquistadors 600 years ago. Half complete in 2009, the whole route has now been mapped by Rick Morales, who himself completed it in just more than three months. More information: Transpanama.org  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>John Szalay ends 51 years of Newport-Ensenada sailrace - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>John Szalay, 79, competed for 51 consecutive years in largest point-to-point international sail race, between Newport, California, and Ensenada, Mexico.</descricao>
            <corpo>Ensenada, Mexico (CNN)The ol' mariner is hanging up his sails, after a half century of racing. The amateur has competed for 51 consecutive years in what's touted as the world's largest point-to-point international race, between Newport, California, and Ensenada, Mexico. Now John Szalay, 79, a Hungarian immigrant to the U.S. and a retired engineer and executive, is calling it quits, having competed in his last Newport-to-Ensenada race in April. "It's absolutely beautiful being on the water, it is so self-satisfying," Szalay said after having completed what he says is his last race. "You are living in God's country as far as I'm concerned, in southern California. For me, that was my relaxation." Only once in 51 years of competing did Szalay not finish the 125-nautical-mile race. That's when his engine faltered before the race, and a storm brewed with 48-knot winds and 15-foot seas. It was a reluctant but wise decision. "It was the only time we quit," he said, adding that his engine indeed died a half mile from his home harbor, in Newport Beach, California. "His track record is a rare achievement, even for an amateur in a sail race that has attracted such pros as Dennis Conner and Steve Fossett," said Dave Shockley, commodore of the race organizer Newport Ocean Sailing Association. Celebrities such as the late Humphrey Bogart and Buddy Ebsen have also raced the regatta. Amateur racing for 50-plus years is a mantle few share. Theirs is a tale of passion and romance for the seas. These sailors earn a name that evokes an ancient order of sportsmanship: Corinthian. "We do have a few 50-year people, but they are few and far between, and you'd have to try real hard to find someone as competitive and Corinthian a sailor as John," Shockley said. The Newport-to-Ensenada contest is also notable for how it features a panorama of the mountainous southern California and Baja coast and their offshore islands, ending in what's become the heart of Mexico's wine country. The Ensenada area produces 90% of Mexico's wines. If there's a timeless standard for a true sailor, perhaps it lies in the non-professional skipper who finds a way onto the water even while raising a family and holding a full-time job. Szalay immigrated to the U.S. at age 21 when he left his native Hungary during its 1956 Revolution. He arrived with his then girlfriend, Edith, now his wife since 1959. Szalay had no money and didn't speak English, but through ambition and hard work, he became a mechanical and electrical engineer. By the age of 35, he became president of engineering firm with 2,500 employees. "I was driven all my life," said Szalay, who's been retired for 11 years after a career largely in management, including at aerospace firms. "In a way, I'm a very, very lucky person. I'm an immigrant who came here with nothing and ended up doing very well," he added. He still speaks with a slight accent. It was in his native Hungary where he first went boating at about age 14. A friend took him to his parents' cottage beside the largest lake in central Europe, Hungary's Lake Balaton. They sailed. And that's where it began. "I absolutely fell in love with it," Szalay said. When he later bought a sailboat in his newly adopted country of the U.S., he asked his first son, then aged four, what to name their sailboat. The son, John Jr., chose a whimsical name that has been used ever since for the family boat: Pussycat. "Are you sure?" the father asked the son. "I want it named pussycat," the son replied, according to the father. "Fine," the father said. "So the boat name stayed," Szalay added. The boy became obsessed with the word apparently because a neighbor owned a cat he liked. When the older son became a graphic designer and artist, he even painted a grinning Cheshire cat on the stern. Since then, the name has been assigned to every boat the family owned and raced over five decades: a 26-foot-long Excalibur, a 30-foot-long San Juan, and their current 34-foot-long Peterson, all sloops. The amateur sail racing community has had its fun with the name. But when Szalay earned a reputation as a racer who often finished at the top of his class, sailors playfully used the boat name in another way -- "Meeeeow!" became the sailors' cheer. In all, Szalay finished first in class a total of 10 times in the Newport to Ensenada race, and he's finished either 2nd, 3rd or 4th in class in almost every one of the 50 races he completed, Szalay said. Szalay remembers his early sail racing years, in the 1960s, when sailors didn't have GPS or cockpit display screens for navigation. Navigation was done by dead reckoning with a radio direction finder and a chart. "I don't know how close we were to positioning, but we were able to navigate," Szalay said. "I mean, people navigated before GPS. Columbus navigated." His best race wasn't one where he felt he showed his best helmsmanship or tactical skills. It was about five years when, for the first time ever, both of his children joined him in the Newport-to-Ensenada race. "For the first time in my life, both sons came with us, and we won the race (in class)," Szalay said. "Of all the races I've done, that was the top." While Szalay doesn't directly mention it, what makes the brothers' participation more remarkable is how the younger son, Rene, now 47, uses a wheelchair because he has cerebral palsy. As such, Rene is assigned jobs in the cockpit during races. In fact, he was part of the crew in this year's race. With several other crew members beside him, Rene Szalay thanked his mates for accommodating his disability in the cockpit in this year's race. "We all love each other. I mean, I am a pain in the ass to get on the boat. I really am," he told them, pointing to the wheelchair in which he sat. His father, however, disagreed. His son posed no problem, he added. But Rene Szalay was also especially fond of the same race cited by his father. "That was the best day of my life," Rene Szalay recounted, with his father also beside him. "I will never forget sitting on the transom with you and my brother and having a beer. "For me to be there and to have experienced it, I could have died that day," the younger son told his father. Carol Kokol, a crew member who's raced aboard Szalay's boat for more than the past 25 years, said the team consists of very good friends who like to work hard. "So John's attributes are these: Number one, he expects to win," said Kokol, who's full-time job is a real estate agent in Costa Mesa, California. "He leaves the dock expecting to win. He works on the boat almost daily." Then she adds something else about the restless captain. "And every time we hit the finish line, he thinks we're in dead-ass last place‚Äîbecause we don't see any boats around us" that are in the same class, Kokol said. Added crew member Rob Daugherty: "It's a passion for me, too. He fills my passion for racing, too." Daugherty, a 63-year-old engineer from Irvine, California, has raced with Szalay for almost 28 years. Joining them has been Daugherty's nephew, Blake Thornley, 42, though for a few years short of that mark. So it's been a family experience by blood as well as in spirit. In this year's race, his final, Szalay and crew finished second in their class. John Szalay blames it on being dead in the water twice during the race with winds of "zero speed." "That was to me frustrating. But that's sailboat racing," Szalay said. It's frustrating enough that he's having second thoughts on his retirement from racing, he jokes. Such is the soul of a mariner. CNN's Michael Martinez sailed in advance of the Newport to Ensenada Race aboard skipper J. Scott Huston's cutter sloop, the Permanent Waves. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>15 best restaurants to eat at in 2015 - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Some of our favorite restaurants are heading East while others are perfecting their traditional cuisines at home.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's going to be a great year for global foodies. Some of the world's biggest restaurants are exporting their brands to other countries -- some permanently, others only temporarily -- while top chefs are opening exciting new ventures. Here are some restaurant openings and events we can't wait to experience, as well as a few classics worth revisiting. Santina (New York) The Mario Carbone, Jeff Zalaznick and Rich Torrisi partnership expands with the recent launch of Santina near the Highline in Manhattan. Despite the Meatpacking District location, the focus here is on seafood, along with the group's Italian cuisine, which has proved successful in their Carbone restaurants in both New York and Hong Kong. Santina is named after Mario's grandmother, so Sicily will be featured strongly on the menu. Santina, 820 Washington St., New York; +1 212 254 3000 The Fat Duck (Melbourne, Australia) Heston Blumenthal's groundbreaking Fat Duck is temporarily decamping from wintry Berkshire in the UK to sunnier climes in Melbourne, Australia. The relocation to The Crown Towers Hotel offers diners the same three-Michelin-star experience and menu as the original, promising "a multi-sensory phantasmagoria." You're out of luck though if you'd like a table -- all reservations for the six-month stint have already been filled via an online ballot system that's now closed. Time to work that network of yours for an invite. The Fat Duck will be in Melbourne from February 3 to August 15, 2015. The Fat Duck, Level 3 Crown Towers, 8 Whiteman St., Southbank, Melbourne, Australia; +61 3 9292 5778 Noma at The Mandarin Oriental Tokyo Great chefs apparently think alike -- Rene Redzepi's Copenhagen-based NOMA is also taking a break from Europe and heading East, in this case for a stint at Tokyo's Mandarin Oriental hotel from January 9 until February 14, 2015. Beef tartare with ants, reindeer moss with cep mushrooms and sea urchin and duck are among the 20 servings offered across both the lunch and dinner menus. Once again however the six-week visit has sold out. Noma, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Muromachi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo; +81 3 3270 8800 Tivano, Temple House (Chengdu, China) With 14 million people, China's fourth most populous city is renowned as a gastronome's paradise for its often fiery but always nuanced Sichuan cuisine, available everywhere from street stalls to high-end restaurants. One missing piece in Chengdu has been high-end Western dining. That will change with the May opening of Italian restaurant Tivano in the city's new Temple House hotel that'll specialize in northern Italian cuisine and wines. Tivano, 81 Bitieshi St., Jinjiang District, Chengdu, China; +86 28 6636 9999 Flames, Four Seasons Hotel The Westcliff (Johannesburg) Joburg's venerable Westcliff Hotel, with views over jacaranda tree covered-hills and the elephants of the city's zoo, is reborn as The Four Seasons following a $50 million renovation. With it comes, Flames promises an authentic South African braai (barbecue) experience under chef Dirk Gieselmann. Specialties including boerewors and sosaties alongside kebabs and stellar steaks are accompanied by local beers and wines. Flames, Four Seasons Hotel, The Westcliff, 67 Jan Smuts Ave., Johannesburg; +27 11 481 6000  Chiltern Firehouse (London) Within days of opening, Chiltern Firehouse quickly became London's most talked about restaurant, bar and celebrity draw, a fixture of gossip columns. Dating from 1890, the building originally housed fire engines and now plays host to Portuguese chef Nuno Mendes' innovative cuisine with influences and ingredients from around the world. One downside of its popularity is that reservations can be hard to come by. Chiltern Firehouse, 1 Chiltern St., Marleybone, London; +44 20 7073 7676 Black Sheep (Manila, Philippines) One effect of the growing global appreciation of cuisine from the Philippines has been a restaurant renaissance in the capital Manila. Chef Jordy Navarra, a protege of the Fat Duck, is emblematic of the new wave. He's taken the Heston Blumenthal model of clever deconstruction of dishes and melded it with local Filipino produce, all in a dramatic penthouse setting overlooking the city. Black Sheep, Penthouse at W. 5th Ave., Taguig, Manila, Philippines; +63 2 478 4498 Restaurant David Toutain (Paris) Toutain's eponymous restaurant in the 7th arrondissement quickly won critical and customer acclaim for his inventive and unusual creations. Cauliflower mousse with coconut ice cream or fish with rhubarb and peas show that he isn't shy about pushing boundaries. The setting however is relaxed and un-stuffy and a world away from traditional French haute cuisine. Restaurant David Toutain, 29, Rue Surcouf, Paris; +33 1 45 50 1110 Corner House (Singapore) Jason Tan delivers what he calls "gastro-botanica," an approach that gives equal weight on the plate to protein and plants. The description is further understood given the restaurant's location in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. He reinterprets local dishes such as Kaya Toast. Ohers plates show his classical French training at Robuchon au Dome in Macau. Corner House, 1 Cluny Road, E J H Corner House, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore; +65 6469 1000 Lasai (Rio de Janeiro) In a city more famous for its relaxed beach bars and street food, young chef Rafael Costa e Silva has opened Lasai in the city's Botafogo district. He trained at the legendary Mugaritz in San Sebastian so knows modernist cuisine and fine plating inside out, as reflected in the two tasting menus that feature produce from the restaurant's own gardens as well as the country's famously good meats. Lasai, Rua Conde de Iraja, 191,Rio de Janeiro; +55 21 3449 1834  Zazu (Quito, Ecuador) Zazu's bright, sleek main dining room has a buzzy, laid back international feel, with a clientele to match. Any Ecuadorean will proudly insist that ceviche is their country's national dish, not Peru's. One option at Zazu features local stone crab served with olive oil, chili and, of course, lime juice. The suckling pig tacos might be an even better choice. Zazu, Mariano Aguilerra 331 y La Pradera, Quito, Ecuador; +593 2 254 3559 Statholdergaarden (Oslo, Norway) Bent Stiansen is a titan of Norway's food scene and a former holder of the hugely prestigious Bocuse d'Or. He uses the country's extraordinary natural bounty to maximum effect, with shellfish and other seafood often at the forefront of his six-course Michelin-starred menu. The dining room features crystal, porcelain, chandeliers and fresh flowers under a remarkable stucco ceiling. Statholdergaarden, Radhusgata 11, Oslo; +47 22 41 88 00 Waterside Inn (Bray, UK) Few restaurants are as charming as Michel Roux's legendary Waterside Inn on the banks of the Thames in the culinary hotspot of Bray. It's a temple of French gastronomy, a three Michelin-starred pantheon of la cuisine classique now helmed by Michel's son Alain and run with faultless hospitality from the amuse-bouche through to the petit four. Waterside Inn, Ferry Road, Bray, West Berkshire, United Kingdom; +44 1628 620 691 Amber, The Landmark Mandarin Oriental (Hong Kong) Under Dutch maestro Richard Ekkebus, Amber at the Landmark Mandarin has gone from strength to strength. The mystery for serious diners is why he's not been awarded an elusive but thoroughly merited third Michelin star to join the two he's held for a decade. Ekkebus takes classic French technique and execution and throws in global flavors and produce to deliver often brilliantly innovative dishes, delivering an atlas of exemplary cuisine on a plate. Amber, The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, 15 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong; +852 2132 0066 Chez Panisse (Berkeley, California) Few chefs have had as much impact on contemporary American cuisine as Alice Waters. She opened Chez Panisse back in 1971 and espoused a philosophy that has now become mainstream, namely to eat local, seasonal produce wherever possible. Her legendary Berkeley restaurant is a warm, inviting temple to this thinking where the ingredients do the talking for a menu that changes daily. Chez Panisse, 1517 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, California; +1 510 548 5525 Chris Dwyer is a Hong Kong-based communications consultant and food writer.

            <corpo>(CNN)Tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in the Dominican Republic -- the vast majority Haitians -- face deportation as a deadline to apply for legal status looms. The problem of what to do with thousands of workers who entered illegally from a neighboring country is not an unfamiliar one in the hemisphere. The plight of undocumented immigrants in the United States and lawmakers' failed attempts at reform come to mind. The Dominican government tackled the issue with a "regularization plan" that offered a path to legal status for the undocumented. But critics say it was designed to fail the migrant workers. Wednesday is the deadline for undocumented immigrants in the Dominican Republic to register under the regularization plan or face deportation. "Those who do not have documentation will have to return to their country," Dominican Foreign Minister Andres Navarro said. According to the government, more than 200,000 undocumented immigrants living in the Dominican Republic have registered, but at least that many others will not meet the deadline.  The fact that the majority of foreigners -- documented or not -- living in the Dominican Republic are Haitian has led to accusations that there are other racial prejudices involved, too. The immigration overhaul comes at the same time that Dominicans of Haitian descent are in a fight over their status. A 2013 court ruling stripped the citizenship of Dominicans whose parents were undocumented immigrants. A separate law to address their status is equally controversial. Human rights groups fear mass deportations. The regularization law states its purpose is to "provide a window of opportunity" for undocumented workers to contribute without living in the shadows and to reap the benefits of legal protections offered by the government. Some Dominicans suddenly outsiders in their own country But to hear it in immigrants' own words, those words don't correspond with their experience. "Today is my 15th day here, and I still have not been able to get my documents," Haitian immigrant Ruben Renoir told CNN en Espa√±ol as he waited in a line to apply for legal status. Another immigrant shared a similar story: "I came here with my birth certificate to apply because I knew that there were going to be problems, but they still haven't processed me," Melizo Pierre said.  To human rights observers, this is not surprising. Many of the undocumented workers in the Dominican Republic lack valid passports or other identification documents from their home countries. Some 96% of those who have applied for regularization don't have passports, Angelita Baeyens, programs director at the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, told CNN. Another requirement is for employers to provide the undocumented workers with a certificate, something that many are refusing to do, Baeyens said. Haitian officials, meanwhile, are preparing for an influx of deportees as the deadline passes. At least two repatriation centers have been opened on the border between the two countries to process the Haitians who are sent back from the Dominican Republic. The deadline also worries some people who were born in the Dominican Republic. While there is separate legislation to deal with Dominicans who were stripped of their citizenship, those Dominicans born to Haitian immigrants but not registered in the civil registry fear being swept up in deportation raids. CNN's Mariano Castillo reported and wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN en Espa√±ol's Diulka Perez reported from the Dominican-Haitian border. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>FIFA's Blatter, Valcke may be questioned in Swiss probe - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>World soccer's top official, FIFA President Sepp Blatter, could face questions from Swiss investigators looking into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.</descricao>
            <corpo>Bern, Switzerland (CNN)World soccer's top official, FIFA President Sepp Blatter, could face questions from Swiss investigators looking into the controversial 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process, which saw Russia and Qatar come out as the victors, respectively. Swiss Attorney General Michael Lauber told journalists Wednesday in the Swiss city of Bern that he did not exclude interviewing Blatter and Secretary-General Jerome Valcke as the investigation deepens. Swiss authorities had previously said that Blatter, who has announced he will step down as president, was not part of the inquiry. Lauber also warned that it was going to be a lengthy investigation and that Swiss law prevented him from revealing any detail about it despite what he acknowledged was "enormous public interest" in the case. "The world of football needs to be patient. By its nature, this investigation will take more than the legendary 90 minutes," he said, referring to the length of a soccer match. Lauber added that so far, "the investigation is of great complexity and quite substantial. To give you an example, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General has seized around nine terabytes of data." FIFA has been embroiled in scandal since the United States indicted 14 people, including nine top FIFA officials, on corruption charges last month. The Swiss probe is running simultaneously with the U.S. investigation, but they are being conducted independently of each other, Lauber said. Data gleaned by his investigators will not automatically be shared with the U.S. side. In an interview with CNN, Lauber said the Swiss investigation had "a different target" than its U.S. counterpart and was at an earlier stage in the process. The Swiss probe was opened in March "against persons unknown on the grounds of suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering," he said earlier.  The Swiss investigation was launched on the basis of evidence from a report compiled by former U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia for FIFA and information from the U.S. Department of Justice as well as suspicious banking activities, Lauber told reporters. Besides 104 "banking relations" already known to authorities, he said, each of which represents several bank accounts, banks had flagged up another 53 suspicious transactions via a Swiss anti-money laundering framework. However, Lauber declined to put any value on the sums of money involved, saying some suspicious activities could involve the blocking of funds as well as transfers. The secrecy surrounding the investigation is in part to prevent the loss of evidence, he said, either through records going missing or people talking to each other before they are formally interviewed. So far, Swiss investigators have sought to interview 10 people, Lauber told CNN, but declined to say whether any of those were members of FIFA's executive committee. "It could go further. It is possible I could interview the FIFA president or secretary-general," he said. FIFA has been cooperative, including in searches of its premises, he said, and passed Swiss authorities the Garcia file in the first place. Blatter, as a Swiss national, cannot be extradited from Switzerland to any other country, he added.  Lauber said the complexity of the case was augmented by its global dimensions -- and the interest being paid from around the world. "It's one of the biggest cases I've ever seen," he said. His investigators will have to follow links around the world, he said, and may encounter lawyers trying to slow the process down. But Lauber said he is "very confident" that the team can follow the investigation through to a successful conclusion. "No country in this world can really fight international phenomenons of money laundering or misconduct or corruption on its own. It needs partners abroad, and that's why I'm grateful to have good partners in the (U.S. Department of Justice)," he said. In the United States, prosecutors have alleged that FIFA officials took more than $150 million in bribes to provide "lucrative media and marketing rights" to soccer tournaments. Blatter is not one of those indicted. But U.S. officials told CNN earlier this month that the FBI corruption investigation into FIFA's president continues. FIFA, which insists that any suspected wrongdoing concerns individuals rather than the organization as a whole, has said there are no legal grounds for it to take the 2018 World Cup from Russia or the 2022 event from Qatar. However, Valcke announced last week that FIFA would "postpone" the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup as investigations continue into allegations that bribery helped determine the hosts of earlier events.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. What's next for Philae? At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35¬∫C and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear mission managers on Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <descricao>Jozef Wesolowski, the pope's ex-ambassador to Dominican Republic will be tried on child sex abuse charges at the Vatican next month, Vatican says.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The Pope's former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Jozef Wesolowski -- accused of offenses related to child abuse -- will be tried at the Vatican beginning next month, the Vatican said Monday. Wesolowski, 66, is the highest-ranking former Vatican official to be arrested for allegations related to the sexual abuse of minors and the first to be tried on such charges at the Vatican. Wesolowski is accused of possession of child pornography as well as offenses related to the sexual abuse of minors during his time as papal nuncio to the Dominican Republic. Before arriving in the Dominican Republic in 2008, Wesolowski was nuncio to Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. He began his career as a priest in Krakow, Poland, in 1972 and became a bishop in 2000. In August 2013, the Vatican said it was investigating Wesolowski and removing him from his post, but it did not give a reason. Monsignor Agripino Nunez Collado, a Catholic University rector, said an internal church report linked Wesolowski to child abuse and pedophilia. "We have formally opened an investigation," Dominican Attorney General Francisco Dominguez Brito told reporters at the time. "Here we have to work with two legal aspects, first national laws and also international laws in his status as a diplomat, which implies other mechanisms of investigation and judgment." In January 2014, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi confirmed to the National Catholic Reporter that the Vatican's criminal court was investigating Wesolowski. Pope Francis had announced in July 2013 that he was extending the court's jurisdiction in sex abuse cases to include papal diplomats, making Wesolowski's case the first test of the ruling, the newspaper reported. The Holy See defrocked Wesolowski in June of 2014. Wesolowski is not only charged with offenses during his five years as nuncio of Dominican Republic, but also with child pornography charges committed in Rome between August 2013, when he was recalled, and September 2014, when he was arrested, a Vatican statement said. He also faces charges in the Dominican Republic and in his native Poland, Vatican Radio reported in August. Per the pornography allegations, Italy's Corriere della Sera reported in September that Wesolowski's laptop contained more than 100,000 files with pornographic images and videos, some showing naked teens, between the ages of 13 and 17, forced to have sexual relations with each other or with adults. Some had been downloaded from the Internet and others appeared to have been taken by the victims, the paper reported. Three minors and their mothers are among the prosecution's witnesses, according to Corriere della Sera. When Wesolowski was presented with a detention order in September, the paper reported, he issued a statement: "I can clear my position and explain the mistake." Though the Vatican provided few details on the sex abuse charges, Dominican investigative journalist Nuria Esperanza Piera Gainza reported in 2013 that her sources alleged Wesolowski was a regular in Santo Domingo's Colonial Zone, where he would drink alcohol and pay children to perform sexual acts in the Monument to Friar Antonio de Montesinos, on the outskirts of the zone. "This will be a delicate and detailed procedure, requiring the most careful observations and insights from all parties involved in the trial," the Vatican said. Wesolowski's trial will involve information technology experts and international legal experts to evaluate evidence gathered in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic. The first hearing is scheduled for July 11. It's been reported that rather than being held in an Italian prison or Vatican detention cell, Wesolowski is under house arrest at a Vatican apartment for medical reasons. The church's sexual abuse guidelines allow local dioceses to make the initial decisions on the removal of accused priests. Papal nuncios, however, are appointed and supervised by the Vatican. Before he was elected pope, Francis said he supported a "zero tolerance" approach to clergy sexual abuse. In 2012, when Francis was still Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, he said that when he was asked for advice by another bishop, "I told him to take away the priests' licenses, not to allow them to exercise the priesthood any more, and to begin a canonical trial in that diocese's court." Shortly after his election to the papacy, Francis told a senior Vatican official to "act decisively" against sexual abuse and carry out "due proceedings against the guilty." In July 2013, the pope made it a crime to abuse children sexually or physically on Vatican grounds. The acts were already crimes under church law, but are now specifically outlawed within the Vatican city-state, which is home to hundreds of people.

            <corpo>(CNN)Neymar looks set to play no further part in the Copa America after being suspended for four games by the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). The Brazil striker was sent off at the end of his side's 1-0 Group C defeat by Colombia Wednesday for kicking the ball at opponent Pablo Armero, an act that was already set to bring him an automatic one game ban. But CONMEBOL increased the punishment Friday upon reviewing the case and taking into account Neymar's "subsequent actions" at the final whistle -- although Brazil coach Carlos Dunga hinted that the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) will likely appeal this decision Saturday. TV footage appeared to show Neymar leaning his head aggressively towards Jeison Murillo when the Colombia defender approached him in the aftermath of the ball being struck at Armero. Reports in the Brazilian media also suggested the 23-year-old Barcelona star confronted Chilean referee, Enrique Osses, near the changing rooms after he was ushered down the tunnel by coaching staff. Speaking to reporters Saturday, Dunga said "CBF legal experts will respond to all the action taken against Neymar," in quotes carried by the AFP news agency. "We don't want anything in our favor, we don't want anything against us. We just want it to be balanced," Dunga added. Colombia striker Carlos Bacca was also given a two game ban, without the possibility of appeal, for shoving Neymar in the back during the incident which spoiled Los Cafeteros' first victory over Brazil since 1991. Neymar, who was shackled and frustrated by Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez for much of Wednesday's game, had already been given a yellow card for deliberate handball before seeing red on the full-time whistle. The result marked Brazil's first defeat under Dunga who is 12 games into his second spell in charge of the national team. It was also the Selecao's first reverse since its humiliating 7-1 loss against Germany in the 2014 World Cup semifinal in Belo Horizonte. Neymar missed that game after fracturing a vertebrae in the quarterfinal under a rough challenge from Colombia's Juan Zuniga. As it stands, both Colombia and Brazil have three points from two games in this year's Copa America and can progress to the next stage Sunday when they face Peru and Venezuela respectively.  Despite some exciting matches its fair to say the 2015 Copa America hasn't been the happiest tournament for some of South America's biggest football stars thus far. Uruguay's Luis Suarez didn't even make the competition owing to his ongoing ban from international competition for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at last year's World Cup. And before Neymar's ban Juventus and Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal crashed his Ferrari while allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Vidal did turn out for Chile as it thrashed Bolivia 5-0 in Santiago Friday, however, to qualify for the quarterfinals as winners of Group A. The tournament hosts will be joined in the next stage by it's vanquished opponent which qualifies in second place despite the heavy loss thanks to an earlier draw against Mexico and victory over Ecuador. Ecuador defeated Mexico 2-1 in Friday's other Group A game. Read: Neymar blunted by "The Rock"  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Paraguay: We're protecting life of pregnant 10-year-old - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Paraguay's government says it's doing it everything it can to protect the life of a pregnant 10-year-old and the fetus she's carrying.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Paraguay's foreign ministry says it doesn't need to follow steps recommended by an international human rights committee that weighed in recently on how the country is handling the case of a 10-year-old pregnant girl who was allegedly raped by her stepfather. In a statement released Sunday, the foreign ministry said it rejects a list of demands from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights about what it should do to protect the life of the girl. Paraguay already "has taken all the appropriate measures to avoid impunity for the wrongful act committed and to ensure the life and safety of this girl and the fetus," the statement said. Last week, the human rights commission, which is part of the Organization of American States, cited recent testimony from U.N. experts saying Paraguay's government had "failed in its responsibility to protect a 10-year old sexual abuse survivor and provide her with critical and timely treatments, including a 'safe and therapeutic' abortion." At issue is Paraguayan law, which bans abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother's life. The Paraguayan Ministry of Health has said there's no indication that the health of the girl is at risk. But the human rights commission said that the girl, now 26 weeks pregnant, is facing a serious health situation with a significant possibility of complications. It criticized the Paraguayan government for not releasing enough information about the case and questioned whether the girl and her family were being provided enough information about the situation and the significant medical risks. The mother of the minor has been imprisoned, charged with breaching her care of duty. Last month, police arrested the girl's 42-year old stepfather, accusing him of raping of the child. He denied this accusations. The case has drawn international attention and sparked debate on the largely taboo issue of incest in South America. According to data from UNICEF, in Paraguay, every day two girls from the ages of 10 and 14 give birth to a baby that is the result of sexual abuse. Paraguay's Ministry of Health says that in 2014, over 680 minors from the ages of 10 to 14 reported a pregnancy. Paraguay has a population of 6.7 million.
